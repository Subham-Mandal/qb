{"kebo101":[null,"Biology is the science of life forms and living processes. The living world\n\n\ncomprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could\n\n\neasily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living\n\n\norganisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea,\n\n\nfire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of\n\n\nall such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe\n\n\nor fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including\n\n\nhuman beings began much later in human history. Societies which\n\n\nindulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited\n\n\nprogress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental\n\n\ndescription of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems\n\n\nof identification, nomenclature and classification.

We should remember here that as\n\n\nwe explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously\n\n\nbeing identified.\n\n\nAs stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;\n\n\nwe know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.\n\n\nThese local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.\n\n\nProbably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we\n\n\ndid not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms\n\n\nwe are talking about.\n\n\nHence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms\n\n\nsuch that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the\n\n\nworld. This process is called\n \nnomenclature\n. Obviously, nomenclature\n\n\nor naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and\n\n\nwe know to what organism the name is attached to. This is\n \nidentification.\n\n\nIn order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established\n\n\nprocedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism. This is\n\n\nacceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are\n\n\nbased on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International\n\n\nCode for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals\n\n\nnamed? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological\n\n\nNomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism\n\n\nhas only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people\n\n\n(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure\n\n\nthat such a name has not been used for any other known organism.\n\n\nBiologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific\n\n\nnames to known organisms.\n \nEach name has two components – the\n\n\nGeneric name\n \nand the\n \nspecific\n \nepithet\n. This system of providing a\n\n\nname with two components is called\n \nBinomial nomenclature\n. This\n\n\nnaming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists\n\n\nall over the world. This naming system using a two word format was\n\n\nfound convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the\n\n\nway of providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is\n\n\nwritten as\n \nMangifera indica\n. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this\n\n\nname\n \nMangifera\n \nrepresents the genus while\n \nindica,\n \nis a particular species,\n\n\nor a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:\n\n\n1.\n \nBiological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.\n\n\nThey are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their\n\n\norigin.\n\n\n2.\n \nThe first word in a biological name represents the genus while\n\n\nthe second component denotes the specific epithet.\n\n\n3.\n \nBoth the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are\n\n\nseparately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin\n\n\norigin.\nRationalised 2023-24","T\nHE\n \nL\nIVING\n \nW\nORLD\n \n5\n\n\n4.\n \nThe first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter\n\n\nwhile the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can be\n\n\nillustrated with the example of\n \nMangifera indica\n.\n\n\nName of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of\n\n\nthe biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g.,\n \nMangifera\n\n\nindica\n \nLinn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.\n\n\nSince it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is\n\n\nnecessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is\n\n\nclassification\n. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped\n\n\ninto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.\n\n\nFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or\n\n\ndogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate\n\n\ncertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you\n\n\nsee when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’\n\n\nand not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are\n\n\ntalking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,\n\n\nof course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in\n\n\nplants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be\n\n\nof wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,\n\n\n‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient\n\n\ncategories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these\n\n\ncategories is\n \ntaxa\n. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate\n\n\ncategories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is\n\n\nalso a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you\n\n\nknow that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,\n\n\n‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.\n\n\nHence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified\n\n\ninto different taxa. This process of classification is\n \ntaxonomy\n. External\n\n\nand internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development\n\n\nprocess and ecological information of organisms are essential and form\n\n\nthe basis of modern taxonomic studies.\n\n\nHence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature\n\n\nare the processes that are basic to taxonomy.\n\n\nTaxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been\n\n\ninterested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of\n\n\norganisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,\n\n\nhuman beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing\n\n\nand shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of\n\n\nvarious organisms.\n\n\nHuman beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more\n\n\nabout different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the\n\n\nrelationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as\n\n\nsystematics\n. The word systematics\n \nis derived from the Latin word\n\n\n‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus\nRationalised 2023-24","6\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nused\n \nSystema Naturae\n \nas the\n \ntitle of his publication.\n \nThe scope of\n\n\nsystematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature\n\n\nand classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary\n\n\nrelationships between organisms.\n\n\n1.2\n \nT\nAXONOMIC\n \nC\nATEGORIES\n\n\nClassification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps\n\n\nin which each step represents a rank or category. Since the category is a\n\n\npart of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the\n \ntaxonomic category\n\n\nand all categories together constitute the\n \ntaxonomic hierarchy\n. Each\n\n\ncategory, referred to as a unit of classification,\n \nin fact, represents a rank\n\n\nand is commonly termed as\n \ntaxon\n \n(pl.: taxa)\n.\n\n\nTaxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.\n\n\nInsects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like\n\n\nthree pairs of jointed legs.\n \nIt means insects are recognisable concrete\n\n\nobjects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.\n\n\nCan you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups\n\n\nrepresent category. Category further denotes rank. Each rank or\n \ntaxon\n,\n\n\nin fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/\n\n\ncategories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological\n\n\naggregates.\n\n\nTaxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the\n\n\ndevelopment of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division\n\n\n(for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms,\n\n\nincluding those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the\n\n\nlowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an\n\n\norganism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge\n\n\nof characters of an individual or group of organisms.\n \nThis helps in\n\n\nidentifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the\n\n\nsame kind of organisms\n \nas well as of other kinds of organisms.\n\n\n1.2.1\n \nSpecies\n\n\nTaxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with\n\n\nfundamental similarities as a\n \nspecies\n. One should be able to distinguish\n\n\none species from the other closely related species based on the distinct\n\n\nmorphological differences. Let us consider\n \nMangifera indica\n,\n \nSolanum\n\n\ntuberosum\n \n(potato) and\n \nPanthera leo\n \n(lion). All the three names,\n \nindica,\n\n\ntuberosum\n \nand\n \nleo,\n \nrepresent the specific epithets, while the first words\n\n\nMangifera, Solanum\n \nand\n \nPanthera\n \nare genera and represents another\n\n\nhigher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than\n\n\none specific epithets representing different organisms, but having\n\n\nmorphological similarities. For example,\n \nPanthera\n \nhas another specific\n\n\nepithet called\n \ntigris\n \nand\n \nSolanum\n \nincludes species like\n \nnigrum\n \nand\nRationalised 2023-24","T\nHE\n \nL\nIVING\n \nW\nORLD\n \n7\n\n\nmelongena\n.

Among plants for example, three different genera\n \nSolanum\n,\n\n\nPetunia\n \nand\n \nDatura\n \nare placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals\n\n\nfor example, genus\n \nPanthera\n, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along\n\n\nwith genus,\n \nFelis\n \n(cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the\n\n\nfeatures of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and\n \nsome\n\n\ndifferences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae\n\n\nand Canidae\n,\n \nrespectively\n.\n\n\n1.2.4\n \nOrder\n\n\nYou have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and families are\n\n\nbased on a number of similar characters.\n \nGenerally, order and other\n\n\nhigher taxonomic categories are identified based on the aggregates of\n\n\ncharacters. Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families\n\n\nwhich exhibit a few similar characters. The similar characters are less in\n\n\nnumber as compared to different genera included in a family.\n \nPlant\n\n\nfamilies like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order\n\n\nPolymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal order,\n\n\nCarnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.\n\n\n1.2.5\n \nClass\n\n\nThis category includes related orders. For example, order Primata\n\n\ncomprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along\n\n\nwith order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog.

It was done instinctively not using criteria that were\n\n\nscientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use – for\n\n\nfood, shelter and clothing.\n \nAristotle was the earliest to attempt a more\n\n\nscientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters\n\n\nto classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals\n\n\ninto two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.\n\n\nIn Linnaeus' time a\n \nTwo Kingdom\n \nsystem of classification with\n\n\nPlantae\n \nand\n \nAnimalia\n \nkingdoms was developed that included all\n\n\nplants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between\n\n\nthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms\n\n\nand photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)\n\n\norganisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily\n\n\ndone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms\n\n\ndid not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification\n\n\nused for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology\n\n\na need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,\n\n\nnature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,\n\n\nevolutionary relationships, etc.\n \nClassification systems for the living\n\n\norganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.\n\n\nThough plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all\n\n\ndifferent systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be\n\n\nincluded under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and\n\n\nnature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by\n\n\ndifferent scientists over the time.\n\n\nB\nIOLOGICAL\n \nC\nLASSIFICATION\n\n\nC\nHAPTER\n \n2\n\n\n2.1\n \nKingdom Monera\n\n\n2.2\n \nKingdom Protista\n\n\n2.3\n \nKingdom Fungi\n\n\n2.4\n \nKingdom Plantae\n\n\n2.5\n \nKingdom\n\n\nAnimalia\n\n\n2.6\n \nViruses, Viroids\n\n\nand Lichens\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOLOGICAL\n \nC\nLASSIFICATION\n \n11\n\n\nR.H.

Earlier\n\n\nclassification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses,\n\n\nferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character\n\n\nthat unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a\n\n\ncell wall in their cells.

Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria\n\n\nin having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for\n\n\ntheir survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut\n\n\nof several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are\n\n\nresponsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these\n\n\nanimals.\n\n\nFigure 2.2\n \nA filamentous blue-green\n\n\nalgae –\n \nNostoc\n\n\n2.1.2\n \nEubacteria\n\n\nThere are thousands of different\n \neubacteria\n \nor ‘true\n\n\nbacteria’.

The\n\n\ncyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or filamentous,\n\n\nfreshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies\n\n\nare generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They\n\n\noften form blooms in polluted water bodies.

In this book we\n\n\ninclude Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and\n\n\nProtozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.\n\n\nThis kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals\n\n\nand fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well defined\n\n\nnucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have flagella or\n\n\ncilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving\n\n\ncell fusion and zygote formation.\n\n\n2.2.1\n \nChrysophytes\n\n\nThis group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found\n\n\nin fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic\n\n\nand float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are\n\n\nphotosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,\n\n\nwhich fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica\n\n\nand thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind\n\n\nlarge amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over\n\n\nbillions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this\n\n\nsoil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups.

Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein\n\n\nrich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible.\n\n\nThey have two flagella, a short and a long one. Though\n\n\nthey are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when\n\n\ndeprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by\n\n\npredating on other smaller organisms.

They\n\n\nshow a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You\n \nmust have seen\n\n\nfungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat\n\n\nand toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due\n\n\nto a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make\n\n\nbread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat\n\n\nrust-causing\n \nPuccinia\n \nis an important example. Some are the source of\n\n\nantibiotics, e.g.,\n \nPenicillium\n. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water,\n\n\nsoil and on animals and plants. They prefer to grow in warm and humid\n\n\nplaces. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes,\n\n\nit is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections.\n\n\nWith the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are\n\n\nfilamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures\n\n\ncalled hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae\n\n\nare continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these are\n\n\ncalled coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their\n\n\nhyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides.\n\n\nMost fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from\n\n\ndead substrates and hence are called\n \nsaprophytes\n. Those that depend\n\n\non living plants and animals are called\n \nparasites\n. They can also live as\n\n\nsymbionts\n \n– in association\n \nwith algae as\n \nlichens\n \nand with roots of higher\n\n\nplants as\n \nmycorrhiza\n.\n\n\nReproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means –\n\n\nfragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOLOGICAL\n \nC\nLASSIFICATION\n \n17\n\n\ncalled conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction\n\n\nis by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are\n\n\nproduced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle\n\n\ninvolves the following three steps:\n\n\n(i)\n \nFusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes\n\n\ncalled\n \nplasmogamy.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nFusion of two nuclei called\n \nkaryogamy.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nMeiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.\n\n\nWhen a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid\n\n\nhyphae of compatible mating types come together and\n\n\nfuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells\n\n\nimmediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other\n\n\nfungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening\n\n\ndikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;\n\n\nsuch a condition is called a\n \ndikaryon\n \nand the phase is\n\n\ncalled\n \ndikaryophase\n \nof fungus. Later, the parental nuclei\n\n\nfuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting\n\n\nbodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to\n\n\nformation of haploid spores.\n\n\nThe morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore\n\n\nformation and fruiting bodies\n \nform the basis for the\n\n\ndivision of the kingdom into various classes.\n\n\n2.3.1\n \nPhycomycetes\n\n\nMembers of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats\n\n\nand on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as\n\n\nobligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate\n\n\nand coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by\n\n\nzoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These\n\n\nspores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A\n\n\nzygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These\n\n\ngametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or\n\n\ndissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common\n\n\nexamples are\n \nMucor\n \n(Figure 2.5a)\n, Rhizopus\n \n(the bread\n\n\nmould mentioned earlier) and\n \nAlbugo\n \n(the parasitic fungi\n\n\non mustard).\n\n\n2.3.2\n \nAscomycetes\n\n\nCommonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes are mostly\n\n\nmulticellular, e.g.,\n \nPenicillium\n, or\n \nrarely unicellular, e.g., yeast\n\n\n(\nSaccharomyces\n)\n.\n \nThey are saprophytic, decomposers,\n\n\nparasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung).

They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living\n\n\nplant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched\n\n\nand septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative\n\n\nreproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent,\n\n\nbut plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic\n\n\ncells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic\n\n\nwhich ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take\n\n\nplace in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores\n\n\nare exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are\n\n\narranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members\n\n\nare\n \nAgaricus\n \n(mushroom) (Figure 2.5c)\n, Ustilago\n \n(smut) and\n \nPuccinia\n \n(rust\n\n\nfungus).\n\n\n2.3.4\n \nDeuteromycetes\n\n\nCommonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or\n\n\nvegetative phases of these fungi are known.\n \nWhen the sexual forms of\n\n\nthese fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly\n\n\nbelong to. It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have\n\n\nbeen given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual\n\n\nstage another (and placed under another class).

Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)\n\n\nrecognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of\n\n\ntobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria\n\n\nbecause they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W. Beijerinek\n\n\n(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of\n \ntobacco\n\n\ncould cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen\n\n\n“virus” and called the fluid as\n \nContagium vivum fluidum\n \n(infectious living\n\n\nfluid).\n \nW.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised\n\n\nand crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific\n\n\nhost cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.\n\n\nIn addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could\n\n\nbe either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is\n\n\na nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious.

The main\n\n\ncriteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation,\n\n\nmode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships.\n\n\nIn the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.\n\n\nBacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive\n\n\nmetabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of\n\n\nnutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as\n\n\nChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists\n\n\nhave defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce\n\n\nboth asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity\n\n\nin structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition.\n\n\nThey show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes,\n\n\nBasidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom.\n\n\nThe plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae,\n\n\nbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this\n\n\ngroup. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophytic\n\n\nand sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular\n\n\norganisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of\n\n\nnutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual\n\n\nmode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are\n\n\nnot included in the five kingdom system of classification.\n\n\nViroids :\n \nIn 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that\n\n\nwas smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was\n\n\nfound to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses,\n\n\nhence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight.\n\n\nPrions :\n \nIn modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases\n\n\nwere found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded\n\n\nprotein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called\n\n\nprions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform\n\n\nencephalopathy (BSE) commonly called\n \nmad cow disease in cattle and\n\n\nits analogous variant Cr–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.\n\n\nLichens :\n \nLichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful\n\n\nassociations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as\n\n\nphycobiont\n \nand fungal component as\n \nmycobiont,\n \nwhich are autotrophic\n\n\nand heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi\n\n\nprovide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.\n\n\nSo close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would\n\n\nnever imagine that they had two different organisms within them. Lichens\n\n\nare very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas.\nRationalised 2023-24","22\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nE\nXERCISES\n\n\n1.\n \nDiscuss how classification systems have undergone several changes over a\n\n\nperiod of time?\n\n\n2.\n \nState two economically important uses of:\n\n\n(a) heterotrophic bacteria\n\n\n(b) archaebacteria\n\n\n3.\n \nWhat is the nature of cell-walls in diatoms?\n\n\n4.\n \nFind out what do the terms ‘algal bloom’ and ‘red-tides’ signify.\n\n\n5.\n \nHow are viroids different from viruses?\n\n\n6.\n \nDescribe briefly the four major groups of Protozoa.\n\n\n7.\n \nPlants are autotrophic.

In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further\n\n\nclassification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant\n\n\nkingdom’.\n\n\nWe must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom\n\n\nhas changed over time.

The\n\n\nearliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological\n\n\ncharacters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc. They\n\n\nwere based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium\n\n\nstructure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were\n \nartificial;\n \nthey\n\n\nseparated the closely related species since they were based on a few\n\n\ncharacteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage to\n\n\nvegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know\n\n\nthat often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by\n\n\nenvironment.

They occur in a\n\n\nvariety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them\n\n\nalso occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth\n\n\nbear).\n\n\nThe form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial\n\n\nforms like\n \nVolvox\n \nand the filamentous forms like\n \nUlothrix\n \nand\n \nSpirogyra\n\n\n(Figure 3.1)\n.\n \nA few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant\n\n\nbodies.\n\n\nThe algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.\n\n\nVegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into\n\n\na thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of\n\n\nspores, the most common being the\n \nzoospores\n. They are flagellated\n\n\n(motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction\n\n\ntakes place through fusion of two gametes.

At least a half of the total\n\n\ncarbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through\n\n\nphotosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved\n\n\noxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount\n\n\nimportance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form\n\n\nthe basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals.

The\n\n\nplant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually\n\n\ngrass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll\n \na\n \nand\n \nb\n. The\n\n\npigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be\n\n\ndiscoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in\n\n\ndifferent species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies\n\n\ncalled pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein\n\n\nbesides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.\n\n\nGreen algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose\n\n\nand an outer layer of pectose.\n\n\nVegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by\n\n\nformation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by\n\n\nflagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction\n\n\nshows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it\n\n\nmay be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found\n\n\ngreen algae are:\n \nChlamydomonas,\n \nVolvox,\n \nUlothrix, Spirogyra\n \nand\n \nChara\n\n\n(\nFigure 3.1a)\n.\n\n\n3.1.2\n \nPhaeophyceae\n\n\nThe members of phaeophyceae or\n \nbrown algae\n \nare found primarily in\n\n\nmarine habitats.

Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the\n\n\nform of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall\n\n\nusually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of\n \nalgin\n. The\n\n\nprotoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole\n\n\nand nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a\n\n\nholdfast\n, and has a stalk, the\n \nstipe\n \nand leaf like photosynthetic organ –\n\n\nthe\n \nfrond\n. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual\n\n\nreproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores\n \nthat are\n\n\npear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.\n\n\nSexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.\n\n\nUnion of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium\n\n\n(oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear\n\n\ntwo laterally attached flagella.

They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities.\n\n\nThey play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil.\n\n\nThe plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.\n\n\nIt is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum\n\n\nby unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or\n\n\nleaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The\n\n\nmain plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence\n\n\nis called a\n \ngametophyte\n. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular.\n\n\nThe male sex organ is called\n \nantheridium.\n \nThey produce biflagellate\n\n\nantherozoids\n. The female sex organ called\n \narchegonium\n \nis flask-shaped\n\n\nand produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where\n\n\nthey come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the\n\n\negg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division\n\n\nimmediately. They produce a multicellular body called a\n \nsporophyte\n.\n\n\nThe sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic\n\n\ngametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the\n\n\nsporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid\n\n\nspores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.\n\n\nBryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some\n\n\nmosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.\n\n\nSpecies of\n \nSphagnum\n, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as\n\n\nfuel, and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because\n\n\nof their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first\n\n\norganisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance.\n\n\nThey decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of\n\n\nhigher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the\n\n\nimpact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided\n\n\ninto\n \nliverworts\n \nand\n \nmosses\n.\n\n\n3.2.1\n \nLiverworts\n\n\nThe liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of\n\n\nstreams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods.\n\n\nThe plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g.,\n \nMarchantia\n. The thallus is\n\n\ndorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members\n\n\nhave tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.\n\n\nAsexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of\n\n\nthalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called\n \ngemmae\n\n\n(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which\n\n\ndevelop in small receptacles\n \ncalled gemma cups located on the thalli.\n\n\nThe gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to\n\n\nform new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex\nRationalised 2023-24","30\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\norgans are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The\n\n\nsporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis,\n\n\nspores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form\n\n\nfree-living gametophytes.\n\n\n3.2.2\n \nMosses\n\n\nThe predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which\n\n\nconsists of two stages. The first stage is the\n \nprotonema\n \nstage, which\n\n\ndevelops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and\n\n\nfrequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the\n \nleafy stage\n, which\n\n\ndevelops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of\n\n\nupright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached\n\n\nto the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears\n\n\nthe sex organs.\n\n\nVegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding\n\n\nin the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs\n\n\nantheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.\n\n\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a\n\n\nfoot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than\n\n\nthat in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after\n\n\nmeiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.\n\n\nCommon examples of mosses are\n \nFunaria, Polytrichum\n \nand\n \nSphagnum\n\n\n(Figure 3.2)\n.\n\n\n3.3\n \nP\nTERIDOPHYTES\n\n\nThe Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used\n\n\nfor medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown\n\n\nas ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to\n\n\npossess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about\n\n\nthese tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp,\n\n\nshady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions.\n\n\nYou may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life\n\n\ncycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the\n\n\nmain plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root,\n\n\nstem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated\n\n\nvascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as\n\n\nin\n \nSelaginella\n \nor large (macrophylls) as in ferns.

These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to\n\n\ngrow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for\n\n\nwater for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and\n\n\nrestricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male\n\n\nand female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia,\n \nrespectively.\n\n\nWater is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes released\n\n\nfrom the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete\n\n\nwith the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.\n\n\nZygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte\n\n\nwhich is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes.

Their plant body is more differentiated\n\n\nthan that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to\n\n\nthe substratum by rhizoids.

The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.\n\n\nThe plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosses\n\n\nhave upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The main\n\n\nplant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a\n\n\ngametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia and female\n\n\nsex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes produced\n\n\nfuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a\n\n\nsporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to form\n\n\ngametophytes.\n\n\nIn pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated\n\n\ninto true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated\n\n\nvascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores.\n\n\nThe spores germinate to form\n \ngametophytes which require cool, damp\n\n\nplaces to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called\n\n\nantheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of\n\n\nmale gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation.\n\n\nThe zygote produces a sporophyte.\n\n\nThe gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by\n\n\nany ovary wall.

Besides the fundamental features,\n\n\nthere are many other distinctive characters which are specific for each\n\n\nphyla or class.\n\n\nPorifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of\n\n\norganisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. The\n\n\ncoelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic,\n\n\nsessile or free-floating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb\n\n\nplates. The platyhelminths have flat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry.\n\n\nThe parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are\n\n\npseudocoelomates and\n \ninclude parasitic as well as non-parasitic\n\n\nroundworms.\n\n\nAnnelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom.\n\n\nThe arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised\n\n\nby the presence of jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft body\n\n\nsurrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body is covered with\n\n\nexternal skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.\n\n\nTheir most distinctive feature is the presence of water vascular system.\n\n\nThe hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine animals. They\n\n\nhave a cylindrical body with proboscis, collar and trunk.\n\n\nPhylum Chordata includes animals which possess a notochord either\n\n\nthroughout or during early embryonic life. Other common features\n\n\nobserved in the chordates are the dorsal, hollow nerve cord and paired\n\n\npharyngeal gill slits. Some of the vertebrates do not possess jaws (Agnatha)\n\n\nwhereas most of them possess jaws (Gnathostomata). Agnatha is\n\n\nrepresented by the class, Cyclostomata. They are the most primitive\n\n\nchordates and are ectoparasites on fishes. Gnathostomata has two super\n\n\nclasses, Pisces and Tetrapoda.

The amphibians have adapted\n\n\nto live both on land and water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence\nRationalised 2023-24","A\nNIMAL\n \nK\nINGDOM\n53\n53\n\n\nof dry and cornified skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians\n\n\nand reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-blooded). Aves are warm-blooded\n\n\nanimals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modified into wings\n\n\nfor flying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching or\n\n\nclasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence of mammary\n\n\nglands and hairs on the skin.

In the\n \nhypogynous\n \nflower the\n\n\ngynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated\n\n\nbelow it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be\n \nsuperior,\n \ne.g., mustard,\n\n\nchina rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other\n\n\nparts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the\n\n\nsame level, it is called\n \nperigynous.\n \nThe ovary here is said to be\n \nhalf\n\n\ninferior,\n \ne.g., plum, rose, peach.

After fertilisation, the\n\n\novules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\n\n\nPlacentation:\n \nThe arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known\n\n\nas placentation. The placentation are of different types namely,\n\n\nmarginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.12).\n\n\nIn\n \nmarginal\n \nplacentation the placenta forms a ridge along the\n\n\nventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge\n\n\nforming two rows, as in pea. When the placenta is axial and the\n\n\novules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is\n\n\nsaid to be\n \naxile\n, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In\n \nparietal\n\n\nplacentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or\n\n\non peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-\n\n\nchambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard\n\n\nand\n \nArgemone\n. When the ovules are borne on central axis and\n\n\nsepta are absent, as in\n \nDianthus\n \nand\n \nPrimrose\n \nthe placentation is\n\n\ncalled\n \nfree central.\n \nIn\n \nbasal\n \nplacentation, the placenta develops\n\n\nat the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in\n\n\nsunflower, marigold.\n\n\n5.6\n \nT\nHE\n \nF\nRUIT\n\n\nThe fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants.

The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food,\n\n\nmechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated\n\n\ninto stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems\n\n\nlike the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively\n\n\nphototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Leaf is a\n\n\nlateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are\n\n\ngreen in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis.

Epidermis is usually single-\n\n\nlayered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of\n\n\ncytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the\n\n\nepidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the\n \ncuticle\n \nwhich\n\n\nprevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots.\n \nStomata\n \nare structures\n\n\npresent in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of\n\n\ntranspiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-\n\n\nshaped cells known as\n \nguard cells\n \nwhich enclose stomatal pore\n.\n \nIn\n\n\ngrasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard\n\n\ncells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards\n\n\nthe stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts\n\n\nand regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal\n\n\ncells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and\n\n\nsize and are known as\n \nsubsidiary cells\n.

In the\n\n\nmonocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no\n\n\ncambium present in them. Hence, since they do\n\n\nnot form secondary tissues they are referred to\n\n\nas\n \nclosed\n.

Such vascular\n\n\nbundles are common in stems and leaves. The\n\n\nconjoint vascular bundles usually have the\n\n\nphloem located only on the outer side of xylem.\n\n\n6.2\n \nA\nNATOMY\n \nOF\n \nD\nICOTYLEDONOUS\n \nAND\n\n\nM\nONOCOTYLEDONOUS\n \nP\nLANTS\n\n\nFor\n \na\n \nbetter\n \nunderstanding\n \nof\n \ntissue\n\n\norganisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is\n\n\nconvenient to study the transverse sections of\n\n\nthe mature zones of these organs.\n\n\n6.2.1\n \nDicotyledonous Root\n\n\nLook at Figure 6.3 (a), it shows the transverse\n\n\nsection of the sunflower root.

The innermost\n\n\nlayer of the cortex is called\n \nendodermis.\n\n\nIt comprises a single layer of barrel-\n\n\nshaped cells without any intercellular\n\n\nspaces. The tangential as well as radial\n\n\nwalls of the endodermal cells have a\n\n\ndeposition of water-impermeable, waxy\n\n\nmaterial suberin in the form of\n \ncasparian\n\n\nstrips\n.

Initiation of lateral\n\n\nroots and vascular cambium during the\n\n\nsecondary growth takes place in these\n\n\ncells. The pith is small or inconspicuous.\n\n\nThe parenchymatous cells which lie\n\n\nbetween the xylem and the phloem are\n\n\ncalled\n \nconjuctive\n \ntissue\n. There are\n\n\nusually two to four xylem and phloem\n\n\npatches. Later, a cambium ring develops\n\n\nbetween the xylem and phloem.

A large number of\n \nvascular bundles\n \nare arranged in a ring ;\n\n\nthe ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem.\n\n\nEach vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A\n\n\nlarge number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular\n\n\nspaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the\n \npith\n.\n\n\n6.2.4\n \nMonocotyledonous Stem\n\n\nThe monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number\n\n\nof scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous\n\n\nbundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous\n\n\nparenchymatous ground tissue (Figure\n\n\n6.4 b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and\n\n\nclosed. Peripheral vascular bundles are\n\n\ngenerally smaller than the centrally\n\n\nlocated ones. The phloem parenchyma is\n\n\nabsent, and water-containing cavities are\n\n\npresent within the vascular bundles.\n\n\n6.2.5\n \nDorsiventral\n\n\n(Dicotyledonous) Leaf\n\n\nThe vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf\n\n\nthrough the lamina shows three main\n\n\nparts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and\n\n\nvascular system\n.\n \nThe\n \nepidermis\n \nwhich\n\n\ncovers both the upper surface (adaxial\n\n\nepidermis) and lower\n \nsurface (abaxial\n\n\nepidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous\n\n\ncuticle. The abaxial epidermis generally\n\n\nbears more stomata than the adaxial\n\n\nepidermis. The latter may even lack\n\n\nstomata. The tissue between the upper\n\n\nand the lower epidermis is called the\n\n\nmesophyll\n.

The oval or round and loosely arranged\n\n\nspongy parenchyma\n \nis situated below the palisade cells and extends to\n\n\nthe lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities\n\n\nbetween these cells.\n \nVascular system\n \nincludes vascular bundles, which\n\n\ncan be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles\n\n\nare dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the\n\n\nreticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are\n\n\nsurrounded by a layer of thick walled\n \nbundle sheath cells\n. Look at\n\n\nFigure 6.5 (a) and find the position of xylem in the vascular bundle.\n\n\n6.2.6\n \nIsobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf\n\n\nThe anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in\n\n\nmany ways. It shows the following characteristic differences. In an\n\n\nisobilateral leaf, the stomata are present on both the surfaces of the\n\n\nepidermis; and the mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy\n\n\nparenchyma (Figure 6.5 b).\n\n\nIn grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify\n\n\nthemselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called\n \nbulliform\n\n\ncells.\n \nWhen the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are\n\n\nturgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are flaccid due to water\n\n\nstress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss.\n\n\nThe parallel venation in monocot leaves is reflected in the near similar\n\n\nsizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections\n\n\nof the leaves.\n\n\nS\nUMMARY\n\n\nAnatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are\n\n\nbroadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent\n\n\n(simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water,\n\n\nminerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions\n\n\nof tissues. There are three types of tissue\n \nsystems – epidermal, ground and\n\n\nvascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata\n\n\nand the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk\n\n\nof the plant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular\n\n\ntissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of\n\n\ncambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different\n\n\ntypes. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water,\n\n\nminerals and food material.\n\n\nMonocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their\n\n\ninternal structures.

In the complex body of multicellular\n\n\nanimals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of\n\n\ncells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like\n\n\nHydra\n \nis made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each\n\n\ntype can be in thousands.

These tissues are organised in specific\n\n\nproportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and\n\n\nkidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their\n\n\nphysical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ system,\n\n\ne.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and\n\n\norgan systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour\n\n\nand contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.\n\n\n7.1\n \nO\nRGAN\n \nAND\n \nO\nRGAN\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nThe basic tissues as you have learnt in earlier classes, organise to form\n\n\norgans which in turn associate to form organ systems in the multicellular\n\n\norganisms.

We also notice, after some careful study that the\n\n\ncomplexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend.\n\n\nThis discernable trend is called evolutionary trend (You will study the\n\n\ndetails in class XII). In this chapter, you are being introduced to\n\n\nmorphology and anatomy of frog. Morphology refers to study of form or\n\n\nexternally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term\n\n\nmorphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to\n\n\nthe external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The word\n\n\nanatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internal\n\n\norgans in the animals. You will learn the morphology and anatomy of\n\n\nfrog representing vertebrates.\n\n\n7.2\n \nF\nROGS\n\n\nFrogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibia\n\n\nof phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is\n\n\nRana tigrina.\n\n\nThey do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body\n\n\ntemperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals\n\n\nare called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed\n\n\nchanges in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry\n\n\nland. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their\n\n\nenemies (camouflage). This protective coloration is called mimicry. You\n\n\nmay also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter.\n\n\nDuring this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them\n\n\nfrom extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)\n\n\nand winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.\n\n\n7.2.1 Morphology\n\n\nHave you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery\n\n\ndue to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist\n\n\ncondition. The colour of dorsal side of body is\n\n\ngenerally olive green with dark irregular spots. On\n\n\nthe ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.\n\n\nThe frog never drinks water but absorb it through\n\n\nthe skin.\n\n\nBody of a frog is divisible into head and trunk\n\n\n(Figure 7.1). A neck and tail are absent. Above the\n\n\nmouth, a pair of nostrils is present. Eyes are bulged\n\n\nand covered by a nictitating membrane that\n\n\nprotects them while in water. On either side of eyes\n\n\na membranous tympanum (ear) receives sound\n\n\nsignals.

The hind limbs end in five\n\n\ndigits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four\n\n\ndigits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual\n\n\ndimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound\n\n\nproducing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the\n\n\nfore limbs which are absent in female frogs.\n\n\n7.2.2\n \nAnatomy\n\n\nThe body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as\n\n\ndigestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive\n\n\nsystems with well developed structures and functions (Figure 7.2).\n\n\nThe digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.\n\n\nThe alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the\n\n\nlength of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that\n\n\nleads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube\n\n\nthat opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum\n\n\nand finally opens outside by the cloaca. Liver secretes bile that is stored in\n\n\nthe gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice\n\n\nFigure 7.2\n \nDiagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showing\n\n\ncomplete digestive system\n\n\nIntestine\nUreter\n\n\nRectum\n\n\nCloaca\n\n\nUrinary\n\n\nbladder\n\n\nOesophagus\n\n\nLiver\n\n\nStomach\n\n\nKidney\n\n\nGall\n\n\nbladder\n\n\nFat bodies\n\n\nLung\n\n\nHeart\n\n\nCloacal Aperture\nRationalised 2023-24","82\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ncontaining digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.\n\n\nDigestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted\n\n\nfrom the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed\n\n\nfrom stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The\n\n\nduodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the\n\n\npancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic\n\n\njuices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the\n\n\nintestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in\n\n\nthe inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid\n\n\nwaste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.\n\n\nFrogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In\n\n\nwater, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).\n\n\nDissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.\n\n\nOn land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.\n\n\nThe respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are a\n\n\npair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper\n\n\npart of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the\n\n\nbuccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation\n\n\ngaseous exchange takes place through skin.\n\n\nThe vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have\n\n\na lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood\n\n\nvessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph\n\n\nchannels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the\n\n\nupper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one\n\n\nventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular\n\n\nstructure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood\n\n\nthrough the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-\n\n\nlike conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the\n\n\nheart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).\n\n\nThe veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form\n\n\nthe venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine\n\n\nas well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The\n\n\nformer is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal\n\n\nsystem. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are\n\n\nRBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes\n\n\nand platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment\n\n\nnamely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few\n\n\nproteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the\n\n\nrespective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved\n\n\nby the pumping action of the muscular heart.\n\n\nThe elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well\n\n\ndeveloped excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of\n\n\nkidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark\n\n\nred and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity\n\n\non both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several\n\n\nstructural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.\n\n\nTwo ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as\n\n\nurinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and\nRationalised 2023-24","S\nTRUCTURAL\n \nO\nRGANISATION\n \nIN\n \nA\nNIMALS\n \n83\n\n\noviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is\n\n\npresent ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog\n\n\nexcretes urea and thus is a\n \nureotelic\n \nanimal. Excretory wastes are carried\n\n\nby blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.\n\n\nThe system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It\n\n\nincludes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical\n\n\ncoordination of various organs of the body is\n\n\nachieved by hormones which are secreted by the\n\n\nendocrine glands. The prominent endocrine\n\n\nglands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid,\n\n\nparathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreatic\n\n\nislets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system\n\n\nis organised into a central nervous system (brain\n\n\nand spinal cord), a peripheral nervous system\n\n\n(cranial and spinal nerves) and an autonomic\n\n\nnervous\n \nsystem\n \n(sympathetic\n \nand\n\n\nparasympathetic). There are ten pairs of cranial\n\n\nnerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosed\n\n\nin a bony structure called brain box (cranium).\n\n\nThe brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brain\n\n\nand hind-brain.

Hind-brain consists of\n\n\ncerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medulla\n\n\noblongata passes out through the foramen\n\n\nmagnum and continues into spinal cord, which\n\n\nis enclosed in the vertebral column.\n\n\nFrog has different types of sense organs, namely\n\n\norgans of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste\n\n\nbuds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and\n\n\nhearing (tympanum with internal ears).

The ear is an organ of\n\n\nhearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).\n\n\nFrogs have well organised male and female\n\n\nreproductive systems. Male reproductive organs\n\n\nconsist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure\n\n\n7.3), which are found adhered to the upper part\n\n\nof kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called\n\n\nmesorchium.

The cells of the human cheek\n\n\nhave an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside\n\n\neach cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus.

Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called\n\n\neukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are\n\n\nprokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrix\n\n\ncalled cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the\n\n\nmain arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various\n\n\nchemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.\n\n\nBesides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound\n\n\ndistinct structures called\n \norganelles\n \nlike the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),\n\n\nthe golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles.\n\n\nThe prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.\n\n\nRibosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells –\n\n\nboth eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic.

The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three\n\n\nlayered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and\n\n\nthen the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs\n\n\ndistinct function, they act together as a single protective unit.

Meanwhile, chemical studies on\n\n\nthe cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled\n\n\nthe scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.\n\n\nThese studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of\n\n\nlipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged\n\n\nin a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the\n\n\npolar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards\n\n\nthe inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated\n\n\nhydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).\n\n\nIn addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol.\n\n\nLater, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes\n\n\nalso possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies\n\n\nconsiderably in different cell types. In human beings, the membrane of the\n\n\nerythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.\n\n\nDepending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be\n\n\nclassified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface\n\n\nof membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in\n\n\nthe membrane.\n\n\nFigure 8.4\n \nFluid mosaic model of plasma membrane\nRationalised 2023-24","94\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nAn improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed\n\n\nby Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as\n \nfluid mosaic model\n\n\n(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables\n\n\nlateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move\n\n\nwithin the membrane is measured as its fluidity.\n\n\nThe fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of\n\n\nview of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,\n\n\nsecretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.\n\n\nOne of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the\n\n\ntransport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable\n\n\nto some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move\n\n\nbriefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this\n\n\nis called the\n \npassive transport\n. Neutral solutes may move across the\n\n\nmembrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration\n\n\ngradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move\n\n\nacross this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of\n\n\nwater by diffusion is called\n \nosmosis\n. As the polar molecules cannot pass\n\n\nthrough the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the\n\n\nmembrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions\n\n\nor molecules are transported across the membrane against their\n\n\nconcentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such\n\n\na transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and\n\n\nis called\n \nactive transport\n, e.g., Na\n+\n/K\n+\n \nPump.\n\n\n8.5.2\n \nCell Wall\n\n\nAs you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms\n\n\nan outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall\n\n\nnot only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical\n\n\ndamage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides\n\n\nbarrier to undesirable macromolecules.

In addition, there are\n\n\nflat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids\n\n\nof the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called\n\n\na lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the\n\n\nsynthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double-\n\n\nstranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are\n\n\npresent in the thylakoids.

At a number of\n\n\nplaces the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which are\n\n\nformed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are the\n\n\npassages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takes\n\n\nplace in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally,\n\n\nthere is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei are\n\n\nalso frequently observed.\n \nCan you recollect names of organisms that\n\n\nhave more than one nucleus per cell?\n \nSome mature cells even lack\n\n\nnucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of\n\n\nvascular plants.\n \nWould you consider these cells as ‘living’?\n\n\nThe nuclear matrix or the\n \nnucleoplasm\n \ncontains nucleolus and\n\n\nchromatin.

The plasma membrane is\n\n\nselectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The\n\n\nendomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All\n\n\nthe cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole\n\n\nform the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion.

It not only controls the activities of organelles\n\n\nbut also plays a major role in heredity.\n\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types:\n\n\nrough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of\n\n\nproteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organelle\n\n\ncomposed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and\n\n\ntransported from the cell. L ysosomes are single membrane structures\n\n\ncontaining enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes\n\n\nare involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are\n\n\nassociated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and\n\n\ngeneration of adenosine triphosphate.

We can take any\n\n\nliving tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic\n\n\nacid (Cl\n3\nCCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry.

It will suffice to\n\n\nsay here that one extracts the compounds, then\n\n\nsubjects the extract to various separation\n\n\ntechniques till one has separated a compound\n\n\nfrom all other compounds. In other words, one\n\n\nisolates and purifies a compound. Analytical\n\n\ntechniques, when applied to the compound give\n\n\nus an idea of the molecular formula and the\n\n\nprobable structure of the compound. All the\n\n\ncarbon compounds that we get from living\n\n\ntissues can be called ‘biomolecules’. However,\n\n\nliving organisms have also got inorganic\n\n\nelements and compounds in them. How do we\n\n\nknow this? A slightly different but destructive\n\n\nexperiment has to be done. One weighs a small\n\n\namount of a living tissue (say a leaf or liver and\n\n\nthis is called wet weight) and dry it. All the water,\n\n\nevaporates. The remaining material gives dry\n\n\nweight. Now if the tissue is fully burnt, all the\n\n\ncarbon compounds are oxidised to gaseous\n\n\nform (CO\n2\n, water vapour) and are removed. What\n\n\nis remaining is called ‘ash’. This ash contains\n\n\ninorganic elements (like calcium, magnesium\n\n\netc). Inorganic compounds like sulphate,\n\n\nphosphate, etc., are also seen in the acid-soluble\n\n\nfraction.

From a chemistry point of view, one can identify\n\n\nfunctional groups like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. But\n\n\nfrom a biological point of view, we shall classify them into amino acids,\n\n\nnucleotide bases, fatty acids etc.\n\n\nAmino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and\n\n\nan acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the\n \nα\n-carbon.\n\n\nHence, they are called\n \nα\n-amino acids. They are substituted methanes. There\n\n\nare four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions. These\n\n\nare hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group\n\n\ndesignated as R group. Based on the nature of R group there are many\n\n\namino acids. However, those which occur in proteins are only of twenty\nRationalised 2023-24","106\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ntypes. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen\n\n\n(the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl\n\n\n(serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1.\n\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially\n\n\nof the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of\n\n\namino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic\n\n\n(lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic\n\n\namino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property\n\n\nof amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH\n2\n \nand –COOH groups. Hence\n\n\nin solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.\n\n\nB is called zwitterionic form.\n\n\nLipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids.\n\n\nA fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group\n\n\ncould be a methyl (–CH\n3\n), or ethyl\n \n(–C\n2\nH\n5\n) or higher number of –CH\n2\n\n\ngroups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16\n\n\ncarbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon\n\n\natoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated\n\n\n(without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double\n\n\nbonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many\n\n\nlipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found\n\n\nesterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides\n\n\nand triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting\n\n\npoint. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain\n\n\nas oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids\n\n\nhave phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.\n\n\nThese are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is\n\n\none example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with\n\n\nmore complex structures.\n\n\nLiving organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which\n\n\nheterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases –\n\n\nadenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to\n\n\na sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found\n\n\nesterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine,\n\n\nthymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic\n\n\nacid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic\n\n\nacids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only.

One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an\n\n\nenzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes,\n\n\nthrough their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts\n\n\ndiffer from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference\n\n\nneeds mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures\n\n\nand high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures\n\n\n(say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally\n\n\nlive under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur\n\n\nsprings), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high\n\n\ntemperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important\n\n\nquality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.\n\n\n9.8.1\n \nChemical Reactions\n\n\nHow do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical\n\n\nreaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical\n\n\nchange simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds.\n\n\nThis is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state\n\n\nof matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour.\n\n\nThese are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and\n\n\nnew bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical\n\n\nreaction. For example:\n\n\nBa(OH)\n2\n \n+ H\n2\nSO\n4\n \n→\n \nBaSO\n4\n \n+ 2H\n2\nO\n\n\nis an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into\n\n\nglucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical\n\n\nprocess refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be\n\n\nexpressed as:\n\n\nrate =\n\n\nδ\n\n\nδ\n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\nRate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical\n\n\nand chemical processes are influenced by temperature among other\n\n\nfactors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half\n\n\nfor every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at\n\n\nrates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed\n\n\nreactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same\n\n\nbut uncatalysed reaction.

However, by using the\n\n\nenzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the\n\n\nreaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed\n\n\nevery second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10\n\n\nmillion times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed!\n\n\nThere are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique\n\n\nchemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each\n\n\nof the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes,\n\n\nis called a metabolic pathway. For example,\n\n\nGlucose\n \n→\n \n2 Pyruvic acid\n\n\nC\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n \n+ O\n2\n \n→\n \n2C\n3\nH\n4\n \nO\n3\n \n+ 2H\n2\nO\n\n\nis actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid\n\n\nthrough ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you\n\n\nstudy respiration in Chapter 12 you will study these reactions. At this\n\n\nstage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two\n\n\nadditional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In\n\n\nour skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed.\n\n\nUnder normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast, during\n\n\nfermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol\n\n\n(alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible.\n\n\n9.8.2\n \nHow do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of\n\n\nChemical Conversions?\n\n\nTo understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already\n\n\nunderstood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion\n\n\nrefers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is\n\n\ncalled a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional\n\n\nstructures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (S) into a product\n\n\n(P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as:\n\n\nS\n \n→\n \nP\n\n\nIt is now understood that the substrate ‘S’ has to bind the enzyme at\n\n\nits ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse\n\n\ntowards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’\n\n\ncomplex. E stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient\n\n\nphenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme\n\n\nactive site, a new structure of the substrate called transition state structure\n\n\nis formed. Very soon, after the expected bond breaking/making is\n\n\ncompleted, the product is released from the active site. In other words,\n\n\nthe structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s).\n\n\nThe pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOMOLECULES\n \n115\n\n\ntransition state structure. There could be many\n\n\nmore ‘altered structural states’ between the stable\n\n\nsubstrate and the product. Implicit in this\n\n\nstatement is the fact that all other intermediate\n\n\nstructural states are unstable. Stability is\n\n\nsomething related to energy status of the\n\n\nmolecule or the structure. Hence, when we look\n\n\nat this pictorially through a graph it looks like\n\n\nsomething as in Figure 9.4.\n\n\nThe y-axis represents the potential energy\n\n\ncontent. The x-axis represents the progression\n\n\nof the structural transformation or states\n\n\nthrough the ‘transition state’. You would notice\n\n\ntwo things. The energy level difference between\n\n\nS and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction\n\n\nis an exothermic reaction. One need not supply\n\n\nenergy (by heating) in order to form the product.\n\n\nHowever, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an\n\n\nendothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much\n\n\nhigher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content\n\n\nof ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’.\n\n\nEnzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the\n\n\ntransition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy.\n\n\n9.8.3\n \nNature of Enzyme Action\n\n\nEach enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a\n\n\nhighly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This\n\n\ncomplex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the\n\n\nunchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product\n\n\ncomplex (EP).\n\n\nThe formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.\n\n\nE + S\n \nES\n \n\n \n→\n\n \nEP\n \n\n \n→\n\n \nE + P\n\n\nThe catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following\n\n\nsteps:\n\n\n1.\n \nFirst, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting\n\n\ninto the active site.\n\n\n2.\n \nThe binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape,\n\n\nfitting more tightly around the substrate.\n\n\n3.\n \nThe active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the\n\n\nsubstrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the\n\n\nnew enzyme- product complex is formed.\n\n\nActivation energy\n\n\nwithout enzyme\n\n\nPotential Energy\n\n\nActivation\n\n\nenergy with enzyme\n\n\nSubstrate (s)\n\n\nProduct (P)\n\n\nProgress of reaction\n\n\nTransition state\n\n\nFigure\n \n9.4\n \nConcept of activation energy\nRationalised 2023-24","116\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n4.\n \nThe enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free\n\n\nenzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and\n\n\nrun through the catalytic cycle once again.\n\n\n9.8.4\n \nFactors Affecting Enzyme Activity\n\n\nThe activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions\n\n\nwhich can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include\n\n\ntemperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific\n\n\nchemicals that regulate its activity.\n\n\nTemperature and pH\n\n\nEnzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH\n\n\n(Figure 9.5). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular\n\n\ntemperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.\n\n\nActivity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low\n\n\ntemperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas\n\n\nhigh temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are\n\n\ndenatured by heat.\n\n\nConcentration of Substrate\n\n\nWith the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic\n\n\nreaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity\n\n\n(V\nmax\n) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the\n\n\nsubstrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the\n\n\nsubstrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no\n\n\nfree enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules\n\n\n(Figure 9.5).\n\n\nThe activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific\n\n\nchemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical\n\n\nFigure 9.5\n \nEffect of change in : (a) pH\n \n(b) Temperature and (c) Concentration of\n\n\nsubstrate on enzyme activity\n\n\nV\nmax\n\n\nVelocity of reaction (V)\n\n\n[S]\n\n\nV\n\n\n2\n\n\nmax\n\n\nK\nm\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\n \n(c)\n\n\npH\n \nTemperature\n\n\nEnzyme activity\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOMOLECULES\n \n117\n\n\nshuts off enzyme activity, the process is called\n \ninhibition\n \nand the chemical\n\n\nis called an\n \ninhibitor\n.\n\n\nWhen the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular\n\n\nstructure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as\n\n\ncompetitive inhibitor\n. Due to its close structural similarity with the\n\n\nsubstrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate-\n\n\nbinding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and\n\n\nas a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic\n\n\ndehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate\n\n\nsuccinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the\n\n\ncontrol of bacterial pathogens.\n\n\n9.8.5\n \nClassification and Nomenclature of Enzymes\n\n\nThousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most\n\n\nof these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the\n\n\ntype of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each\n\n\nwith 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number.\n\n\nOxidoreductases/dehydrogenases:\n \nEnzymes\n \nwhich\n \ncatalyse\n\n\noxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ e.g.,\n\n\nS reduced + S’ oxidised\n \n\n \n→\n\n \nS oxidised + S’ reduced.\n\n\nTransferases:\n \nEnzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than\n\n\nhydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’ e.g.,\n\n\nS - G + S’\n \n\n \n→\n\n \nS + S’ - G\n\n\nHydrolases:\n \nEnzymes catalysing hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide,\n\n\nglycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds.\n\n\nLyases:\n \nEnzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by\n\n\nmechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.\n\n\nIsomerases:\n \nIncludes all enzymes catalysing inter-conversion of optical,\n\n\ngeometric or positional isomers.\n\n\nLigases:\n \nEnzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e.g.,\n\n\nenzymes which catalyse joining of C-O, C-S, C-N, P-O etc. bonds.\n\n\n9.8.6\n \nCo-factors\n\n\nEnzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However,\n\n\nthere are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co-\n\n\nfactors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically\nRationalised 2023-24","118\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nactive. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the\n\n\napoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups,\n\n\nco-enzymes and metal ions.\n\n\nProsthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from\n\n\nother cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For\n\n\nexample, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of\n\n\nhydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group\n\n\nand it is a part of the active site of the enzyme.\n\n\nCo-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with\n\n\nthe apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of\n\n\ncatalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of\n\n\ndifferent enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components\n\n\nof many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine\n\n\ndinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin.\n\n\nA number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form\n\n\ncoordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same\n\n\ntime form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is\n\n\na cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase.\n\n\nCatalytic activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme\n\n\nwhich testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the\n\n\nenzyme.\n\n\nS\nUMMARY\n\n\nAlthough there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical\n\n\ncomposition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The\n\n\nelemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be\n\n\nsimilar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that\n\n\nthe relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems\n\n\nwhen compared to inanimate matter. The most abundant chemical in living\n\n\norganisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (<1000 Da)\n\n\nbiomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids,\n\n\nglycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic\n\n\ncompounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5\n\n\ntypes of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified\n\n\nto glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous\n\n\ncompound.\n\n\nOnly three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and\n\n\npolysaccharides are found in living systems.

Proteins\n\n\nare heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are\n\n\ncomposed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures –\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOMOLECULES\n \n119\n\n\nprimary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic\n\n\nmaterial. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also\n\n\nof the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e.g.,\n\n\nstarch and glycogen). Proteins serve a variety of cellular functions. Many of\n\n\nthem are enzymes, some are antibodies, some are receptors, some are hormones\n\n\nand some others are structural proteins.

All cells reproduce by dividing into two,\n\n\nwith each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they\n\n\ndivide.

It is significant to note that\n\n\nin the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a\n\n\nhuman cell, cell division proper lasts for only\n\n\nabout an hour. The interphase lasts more than\n\n\n95% of the duration of cell cycle.\n\n\nThe M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the\n\n\nseparation of daughter chromosomes\n \n(karyokinesis)\n \nand usually ends\n\n\nwith division of cytoplasm\n \n(cytokinesis).\n \nThe interphase, though called\n\n\nthe resting phase, is the time during which the cell is preparing for division\n\n\nby undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner.\n\n\nThe interphase is divided into three further phases:\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nG\n1\n \nphase (Gap 1)\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nS phase (Synthesis)\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nG\n2\n \nphase (Gap 2)\n\n\nG\n1\n \nphase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation\n\n\nof DNA replication.

In an animal cell,\n\n\nthis is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma\n\n\nmembrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately\n\n\njoins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant\n\n\ncells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell\n\n\nwall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different\n\n\nmechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre\n\n\nof the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral\n\n\nwalls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the\n\n\nformation of a simple precursor, called the\n \ncell-plate\n \nthat\n\n\nrepresents the middle lamella between the walls of two\n\n\nadjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles\n\n\nlike mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the\n\n\ntwo daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is not\n\n\nfollowed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleate\n\n\ncondition arises leading to the formation of syncytium (e.g.,\n\n\nliquid endosperm in coconut).\n\n\nFigure 10.2 c to e\n \n: A diagrammatic\n\n\nview of stages in Mitosis\nRationalised 2023-24","C\nELL\n \nC\nYCLE\n \nAND\n \nC\nELL\n \nD\nIVISION\n \n125\n\n\n10.3\n \nSignificance of Mitosis\n\n\nMitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells\n\n\nonly.

It is very essential to understand the\n\n\nsignificance of this division in the life of an organism.

The growth of multicellular organisms\n\n\nis due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the\n\n\nnucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to\n\n\ndivide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant\n\n\ncontribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the\n\n\nepidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly\n\n\nreplaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues – the apical and\n\n\nthe lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout\n\n\ntheir life.\n\n\n10.4\n \nM\nEIOSIS\n\n\nThe production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion\n\n\nof two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes\n\n\nare formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell\n\n\ndivision that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the\n\n\nproduction of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called\n\n\nmeiosis.\n \nMeiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle\n\n\nof sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid\n\n\nphase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and\n\n\nanimals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features\n\n\nof meiosis are as follows:\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nMeiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called\n\n\nmeiosis I\n \nand\n \nmeiosis II\n \nbut only a single cycle of DNA replication.\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nMeiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated\n\n\nto produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nMeiosis\n \ninvolves\n \npairing\n \nof\n \nhomologous\n \nchromosomes\n \nand\n\n\nrecombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous\n\n\nchromosomes.\n\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n \nFour haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II.\n\n\nMeiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:\n\n\nMeiosis I\n \nMeiosis II\n\n\nProphase I\n \nProphase II\n\n\nMetaphase I\n \nMetaphase II\n\n\nAnaphase I\n \nAnaphase II\n\n\nTelophase I\n \nTelophase II\nRationalised 2023-24","126\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n10.4.1 Meiosis I\n\n\nProphase I:\n \nProphase of the first meiotic division is typically longer and\n\n\nmore complex when compared to prophase of mitosis.

The compaction of chromosomes continues\n\n\nthroughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase\n\n\nI called\n \nzygotene\n. During this stage chromosomes start pairing together\n\n\nand this process of association is called synapsis.

During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent\n\n\nchromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage\n\n\nis characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites\n\n\nat which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the\n\n\nhomologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic\n\n\nmaterial between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is also\n\n\nan enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called\n\n\nrecombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material\n\n\non the two chromosomes.

Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase – a\n\n\nperiod of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) – the actual\n\n\nperiod of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G\n1\n, S and G\n2\n. G\n1\n\n\nphase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism.\n\n\nMost of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks\n\n\nthe phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G\n2\n \nphase is the\n\n\nperiod of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely\n\n\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation\n\n\noccurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite\n\n\npoles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle\n\n\nfibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes\n\n\nat the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the\n\n\nchromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids\n\n\nreach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the\n\n\nnuclear membrane reappear.

It is called the reduction division since it reduces the chromosome\n\n\nnumber by half while making the gametes. In sexual reproduction when the two\n\n\ngametes fuse the chromosome number is restored to the value in the parent.\n\n\nMeiosis is divided into two phases – meiosis I and meiosis II.

He concluded that\n\n\na burning candle or an animal that breathe the air,\n\n\nboth somehow, damage the air. But when he placed a mint plant in the\n\n\nsame bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle\n\n\ncontinued to burn.\n \nPriestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to\n\n\nthe air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove.\n\n\nCan you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment\n\n\nusing a candle and a plant? Remember, he would need to rekindle the\n\n\ncandle to test whether it burns after a few days.\n \nHow many different\n\n\nways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up?\n\n\nUsing a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it\n\n\nonce in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799)\n\n\nshowed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow\n\n\npurifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals.\n\n\nIngenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that\n\n\nin bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts\n\n\nwhile in the dark they did not. Later he identified these bubbles to be of\n\n\noxygen. Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that\n\n\ncould release oxygen.\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nFigure 11.1\n \nPriestley’s experiment\nRationalised 2023-24","P\nHOTOSYNTHESIS\n \nIN\n \nH\nIGHER\n \nP\nLANTS\n \n135\n\n\nIt was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence\n\n\nfor production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as\n\n\nstarch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants\n\n\n(chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called\n\n\nchloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is\n\n\nwhere glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch.\n\n\nNow consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann\n\n\n(1843 – 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components\n\n\nand then illuminated a green alga,\n \nCladophora\n, placed in a suspension\n\n\nof aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O\n2\n\n\nevolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region\n\n\nof blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of\n\n\nphotosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption\n\n\nspectra of chlorophyll\n \na\n \nand\n \nb\n \n(discussed in section 11.4).\n\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant\n\n\nphotosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy\n\n\nto make carbohydrates from CO\n2\n \nand water.\n \nThe empirical equation\n\n\nrepresenting the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving\n\n\norganisms was then understood as:\n\n\nCO\n \nH O\n \nCH O\n \nO\n\n\nLight\n\n\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \n2\n+\n \n\n \n→\n\n\n \n+\n[\n \n]\n\n\nwhere [CH\n2\nO] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon\n\n\nsugar).\n\n\nA milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was\n\n\nthat made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel\n \n(1897-1985), who,\n\n\nbased on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that\n\n\nphotosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which\n\n\nhydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide\n\n\nto carbohydrates. This can be expressed by:\n\n\n2\n \n2\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \n2\nH A\n \nCO\n \nA\n \nCH O\n \nH O\n\n\nLight\n\n\n+\n \n\n \n→\n\n\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\nIn green plants H\n2\nO is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O\n2\n. Some\n\n\norganisms do not release O\n2\n \nduring photosynthesis. When H\n2\nS, instead\n\n\nis the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the\n\n\n‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism\n\n\nand not O\n2\n. Hence, he inferred that the O\n2\n \nevolved by the green plant\n\n\ncomes from H\n2\nO, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using\n\n\nradioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the\n\n\noverall process of photosynthesis is therefore:\n\n\n6\n \n12\n \n6\n \n6\n2\n \n2\n \n6\n \n12\n \n6\n \n2\n \n2\nCO\n \nH O\n \nC H\n \nO\n \nH O\n \nO\n\n\nLight\n\n\n+\n \n\n \n→\n\n\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\nwhere C\n6\n \nH\n12\n \nO\n6\n \nrepresents glucose.

You are definitely right.\n\n\nPhotosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so\n\n\nalso in other green parts of the plants.\n \nCan you name some other parts\n\n\nwhere you think photosynthesis may occur?\n\n\nYou would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the\n\n\nleaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align\n\n\nthemselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the\n\n\noptimum quantity of the incident light.\n \nWhen do you think the\n\n\nchloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls?\n\n\nWhen would they be perpendicular to the incident light?\n\n\nYou have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within\n\n\nthe chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the\n\n\nstroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 11.2). There is a clear\n\n\ndivision of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is\n\n\nresponsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP\n\n\nand NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in\n\n\nturn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light\n\n\ndriven are called\n \nlight reactions\n \n(photochemical reactions).\n \nThe latter\n\n\nare not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light\n\n\nreactions (ATP and NADPH).

We can\n\n\nlook for an answer to this question by trying to\n\n\nseparate the leaf pigments of any green\n \nplant\n\n\nthrough\n \npaper\n \nchromatography.\n \nA\n\n\nchromatographic separation of the leaf pigments\n\n\nshows that the colour that we see in leaves is\n\n\nnot due to a single pigment but due to four\n\n\npigments:\n \nChlorophyll\n \na\na\na\na\na\n \n(bright or blue green\n\n\nin the chromatogram),\n \nchlorophyll\n \nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n \n(yellow\n\n\ngreen),\n \nxanthophylls\n \n(yellow) and\n \ncarotenoids\n\n\n(yellow to yellow-orange). Let us now see what\n\n\nroles various pigments play in photosynthesis.\n\n\nPigments are substances that have an ability\n\n\nto absorb light, at specific wavelengths.\n \nCan you\n\n\nguess which is the most abundant plant\n\n\npigment in the world?\n \nLet us study the graph\n\n\nshowing the ability of chlorophyll\n \na\n \npigment to\n\n\nabsorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure\n\n\n11.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the\n\n\nwavelength of the visible spectrum of light as\n\n\nwell as the VIBGYOR.\n\n\nFrom Figure 11.3a can you determine the\n\n\nwavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll\n\n\na shows the maximum absorption? Does it\n\n\nshow another absorption peak at any other\n\n\nwavelengths too? If yes, which one?\n\n\nNow look at Figure 11.3b showing the\n\n\nwavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis\n\n\noccurs in a plant. Can you see that the\n\n\nwavelengths at which there is maximum\n\n\nabsorption by chlorophyll\n \na,\n \ni.e., in the blue and\n\n\nthe red regions, also shows higher rate of\n\n\nphotosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that\n\n\nchlorophyll\n \na\n \nis the chief pigment associated\n\n\nwith photosynthesis.\n \nBut by looking at Figure\n\n\n11.3c can you say that there is a complete one-\n\n\nto-one\n \noverlap\n \nbetween\n \nthe\n \nabsorption\n\n\nspectrum of chlorophyll a and the action\n\n\nspectrum of photosynthesis?\n\n\nFigure 11.3a\n \nGraph showing the absorption\n\n\nspectrum of chlorophyll\n \na, b\n \nand\n\n\nthe carotenoids\n\n\nFigure 11.3b\n \nGraph\n \nshowing\n \naction\n\n\nspectrum of photosynthesis\n\n\nFigure 11.3c\n \nGraph\n \nshowing\n \naction\n\n\nspectrum\n \nof\n \nphotosynthesis\n\n\nsuperimposed on absorption\n\n\nspectrum of chlorophyll\n \na\nRationalised 2023-24","138\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nThese graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes\n\n\nplace in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis\n\n\ndoes take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Let us\n\n\nsee how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment\n\n\nresponsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll\n\n\nb,\n \nxanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments,\n\n\nalso absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll\n \na\n. Indeed, they\n\n\nnot only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised\n\n\nfor photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll\n \na\n \nfrom photo-oxidation.\n\n\n11.5\n \nW\nHAT\n \nIS\n \nL\nIGHT\n \nR\nEACTION\n?\n\n\nLight reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase\n\n\ninclude light absorption, water splitting, oxygen\n\n\nrelease, and the formation of high-energy\n\n\nchemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH.\n\n\nSeveral protein complexes are involved in the\n\n\nprocess. The pigments are organised into two\n\n\ndiscrete photochemical\n \nlight\n \nharvesting\n\n\ncomplexes\n \n(\nLHC\n) within the\n \nPhotosystem I (PS\n\n\nI)\n \nand\n \nPhotosystem II (PS II\n). These are named\n\n\nin the sequence of their discovery, and not in the\n\n\nsequence in which they function during the light\n\n\nreaction.\n \nThe LHC are made up of hundreds of\n\n\npigment molecules bound to proteins. Each\n\n\nphotosystem has all the pigments (except one\n\n\nmolecule of chlorophyll\n \na\n) forming a light\n\n\nharvesting system also called\n \nantennae\n \n(Figure\n\n\n11.4).\n \nThese\n \npigments\n \nhelp\n \nto\n \nmake\n\n\nphotosynthesis more efficient by absorbing\n\n\ndifferent wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll\n \na\n \nmolecule forms the\n\n\nreaction centre.\n \nThe reaction centre is different in both the photosystems.\n\n\nIn PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll\n \na\n \nhas an absorption peak at 700\n\n\nnm, hence is called\n \nP700,\n \nwhile in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680\n\n\nnm, and is called\n \nP680\n.\n\n\n11.6\n \nT\nHE\n \nE\nLECTRON\n \nT\nRANSPORT\n\n\nIn photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll\n \na\n \nabsorbs 680 nm\n\n\nwavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump\n\n\ninto an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus.

The electrons are not used up\n\n\nas they pass through the electron transport\n\n\nchain, but are passed on to the pigments of\n\n\nphotosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons\n\n\nin the reaction centre of PS I are also excited\n\n\nwhen they receive red light of wavelength 700\n\n\nnm and are transferred to another accepter\n\n\nmolecule that has a greater redox potential.\n\n\nThese electrons then are moved downhill again,\n\n\nthis time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP\n+\n.\n\n\nThe addition of these electrons reduces NADP\n+\n\n\nto NADPH + H\n+\n.

This is\n\n\nachieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of\n\n\nwater is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H\n+\n, [O] and electrons.\n\n\nThis creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis.

Photo-\n\n\nphosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from\n\n\nADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of\n\n\nlight. When the two photosystems work in a\n\n\nseries, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called\n\n\nnon-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The\n\n\ntwo photosystems are connected through an\n\n\nelectron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the\n\n\nZ scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H\n+\n \nare\n\n\nsynthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure\n\n\n11.5).\n\n\nWhen only PS I is functional, the electron is\n\n\ncirculated within the photosystem and the\n\n\nphosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of\n\n\nelectrons (Figure 11.6). A possible location\n\n\nwhere this could be happening is in the stroma\n\n\nlamellae.\n \nWhile the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I\n\n\nand PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP\n\n\nreductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP\n+\n \nbut is\n\n\ncycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain\n\n\n(Figure 11.6). The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP,\n\n\nbut not of NADPH + H\n+\n. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when\n\n\nonly light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.\n\n\n11.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis\n\n\nLet us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the\n\n\nchloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain\n\n\nthe mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is\n\n\nlinked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time\n\n\nthese are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here\n\n\nthe proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the\n\n\nlumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of\n\n\nthe mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 12).\n\n\nLet us understand what causes the proton gradient across the\n\n\nmembrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during\n\n\nthe activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that\n\n\ncause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 11.7).\n\n\n(a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of\n\n\nthe membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by\n\n\nthe splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.\n\n\nFigure 11.6\n \nCyclic photophosphorylation\n\n\nPhotosystem I\n\n\nLight\n\n\ne- acceptor\n\n\nElectron\n\n\ntransport\n\n\nsystem\n\n\nChlorophyll\n\n\nP 700\n\n\nADP+\niP\n \nATP\nRationalised 2023-24","P\nHOTOSYNTHESIS\n \nIN\n \nH\nIGHER\n \nP\nLANTS\n \n141\n\n\n(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported\n\n\nacross the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of\n\n\nelectron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane\n\n\ntransfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier.\n\n\nHence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while\n\n\ntransporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron\n\n\nto the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton\n\n\nis released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.\n\n\n(c)\n \nThe NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the\n\n\nmembrane.\n \nAlong with electrons that come from the acceptor of\n\n\nelectrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP\n+\n \nto\n\n\nNADPH+ H\n+\n. These protons are also removed from the stroma.\n\n\nHence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in\n\n\nnumber, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates\n\n\na proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable\n\n\ndecrease in pH in the lumen.\n\n\nWhy are we so interested in the proton gradient?\n \nThis gradient is\n\n\nimportant because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the\n\n\nsynthesis of ATP. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of\n\n\nprotons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane\n\n\nFigure 11.7\n \nATP synthesis through chemiosmosis\nRationalised 2023-24","142\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nchannel of the CF\n0\n \nof the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists\n\n\nof two parts: one called the CF\n0\n \nis embedded in the thylakoid membrane\n\n\nand forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion\n\n\nof protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF\n1\n \nand\n\n\nprotrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side\n\n\nthat faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough\n\n\nenergy to cause a conformational change in the CF\n1\n \nparticle of the ATP\n\n\nsynthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-\n\n\npacked ATP.\n\n\nChemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton\n\n\ngradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a\n\n\nmembrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within\n\n\nthe thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of\n\n\nprotons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate\n\n\nATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.\n\n\nAlong with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the\n\n\nATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in\n\n\nthe stroma, responsible for fixing CO\n2\n, and synthesis of sugars.\n\n\n11.7\n \nW\nHERE\n \nARE\n \nTHE\n \nATP\n \nAND\n \nNADPH U\nSED\n?\n\n\nWe learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O\n2\n. Of\n\n\nthese O\n2\n \ndiffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to\n\n\ndrive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars.\n\n\nThis is the\n \nbiosynthetic phase\n \nof photosynthesis. This process does not\n\n\ndirectly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products\n\n\nof the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO\n2\n \nand H\n2\nO. You may\n\n\nwonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light\n\n\nbecomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time,\n\n\nand then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again.\n\n\nCan we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark\ndark\ndark\ndark\ndark\n\n\nreaction\nreaction\nreaction\nreaction\nreaction is a misnomer?

Since\n\n\nthen CO\n2\n \nassimilation during photosynthesis was said to be of two main\n\n\ntypes: those plants in which the first product of CO\n2\n \nfixation is a C\n3\n \nacid\n\n\n(PGA), i.e., the\n \nC\n3\n \npathway,\n \nand those in which the first product was a C\n4\n\n\nacid (OAA), i.e., the\n \nC\n4\n \npathway\n.\n \nThese two groups of plants showed\n\n\nother associated characteristics that we will discuss later.\n\n\n11.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO\n2\n\n\nLet us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who\n\n\nwere struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’.\n \nHow many carbon atoms\n\n\nwould a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO\n2\n, would have 3\n\n\ncarbons (of PGA)?\n\n\nThe studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule\n\n\nwas a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).\n \nDid any\n\n\nof you think of this possibility?\n \nDo not worry; the scientists also took\n\n\na long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion.\n\n\nThey also believed that since the first product was a C\n3\n \nacid, the primary\n\n\nacceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying\n\n\nto identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon\n\n\nRuBP.\n\n\n11.7.2 The Calvin Cycle\n\n\nCalvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed\n\n\nthat the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated.\n\n\nLet us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is\n\n\nsynthesised. Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin\n\n\npathway occurs in\n \nall photosynthetic plants\n; it does not matter whether\n\n\nthey have C\n3\n \nor C\n4\n \n(or any other) pathways (Figure 11.8).\n\n\nFor ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under\n\n\nthree stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration.\n\n\n1.\n \nCarboxylation\n \n– Carboxylation is the fixation of CO\n2\n \ninto a stable organic\n\n\nintermediate. Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle\n\n\nwhere CO\n2\n \nis utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.\n \nThis reaction is\n\n\ncatalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation\n\n\nof two molecules of 3-PGA.

The enzyme\n\n\nresponsible for this fixation is\n \nPEP carboxylase\n \nor PEPcase. It is important\n\n\nto register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme.

To understand\n\n\nphotorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of\n\n\nthe Calvin pathway – the first CO\n2\n \nfixation step. This is the\n \nreaction\n\n\nwhere RuBP combines with CO\n2\n \nto form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is\n\n\ncatalysed by RuBisCO.\n\n\nRuBP\n \nCO\n \nPGA\nRuBisCo\n+\n \n\n \n→\n\n \n×\n2\n \n2\n \n3\n\n\nRuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you\n\n\nwonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to\n\n\nboth CO\n2\n \nand O\n2\n \n– hence the name.\n \nCan you think how this could be\n\n\npossible?\n \nRuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO\n2\n \nwhen the CO\n2\n: O\n2\n\n\nis nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This\n\n\nbinding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O\n2\n \nand CO\n2\n \nthat\n\n\ndetermines which of the two will bind to the enzyme.\n\n\nIn C\n3\n \nplants some O\n2\n \ndoes bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO\n2\n \nfixation is\n\n\ndecreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of\n\n\nPGA binds with O\n2\n \nto form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and\n\n\nphosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In\n\n\nthe photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of\n\n\nATP. Rather it results in the release of CO\n2\n \nwith the utilisation of ATP. In\n\n\nthe photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH.\n\n\nThe biological function of photorespiration is not known yet.\n\n\nIn C\n4\n \nplants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they\n\n\nhave a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO\n2\n \nat the enzyme\n\n\nsite.\n \nThis takes place when the C\n4\n \nacid from the mesophyll is broken\n\n\ndown in the bundle sheath cells to release CO\n2\n \n– this results in increasing\n\n\nthe intracellular concentration of CO\n2\n. In turn, this ensures that the\n\n\nRuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity.\n\n\nNow that you know that the C\n4\n \nplants lack photorespiration, you\n\n\nprobably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these\n\n\nplants.

The plant factors include\n\n\nthe number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and\n\n\nchloroplasts, internal CO\n2\n \nconcentration and the amount of chlorophyll.\n\n\nThe plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition\n\n\nand the growth of the plant.\n\n\nThe external factors would include the availability of sunlight,\n\n\ntemperature, CO\n2\n \nconcentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises,\n\n\nall these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several\n\n\nfactors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO\n2\n \nfixation,\n\n\nusually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate.\n\n\nHence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at\n\n\nsub-optimal levels.\n\n\nWhen several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s\n\n\n(1905)\n \nLaw of Limiting Factors\n \ncomes into effect. This states the following:\n\n\nIf a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its\n\n\nrate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal\n\n\nvalue: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is\n\n\nchanged.\n\n\nFor example, despite the presence of a green\n\n\nleaf and optimal light and CO\n2\n \nconditions, the\n\n\nplant may not photosynthesise if the temperature\n\n\nis very low. This leaf, if given the optimal\n\n\ntemperature, will start photosynthesising.\n\n\n11.10.1\n \nLight\n\n\nWe need to distinguish between light quality, light\n\n\nintensity and the duration of exposure to light,\n\n\nwhile discussing light as a factor that affects\n\n\nphotosynthesis. There is a linear relationship\n\n\nbetween incident light and CO\n2\n \nfixation rates at\n\n\nlow light intensities. At higher light intensities,\n\n\ngradually the rate does not show further increase\n\n\nas other factors become limiting (Figure 11.10).\n\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that light saturation\n\n\noccurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence,\n\n\nexcept for plants in shade or in dense forests, light\n\n\nis rarely a limiting factor in nature.

Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an\n\n\nincrease in CO\n2\n \nfixation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging\n\n\nover longer periods.\n\n\nThe C\n3\n \nand C\n4\n \nplants respond differently to CO\n2\n \nconcentrations. At\n\n\nlow light conditions neither group responds to high CO\n2\n \nconditions. At\n\n\nhigh light intensities, both C\n3\n \nand C\n4\n \nplants show increase in the rates of\n\n\nphotosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C\n4\n \nplants show\n\n\nsaturation at about 360\n \nµ\nlL\n-1\n \nwhile C\n3\n \nresponds to increased CO\n2\n\n\nconcentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450\n \nµ\nlL\n-1\n. Thus, current\n\n\navailability of CO\n2\n \nlevels is limiting to the C\n3\n \nplants.\n\n\nThe fact that C\n3\n \nplants respond to higher CO\n2\n \nconcentration by\n\n\nshowing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity\n\n\nhas been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell\n\n\npepper. They are allowed to grow in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere\n\n\nthat leads to higher yields.\n\n\n11.10.3\n \nTemperature\n\n\nThe dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though\n\n\nthe light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a\n\n\nmuch lesser extent. The C\n4\n \nplants respond to higher temperatures and\n\n\nshow higher rate of photosynthesis while C\n3\n \nplants have a much lower\n\n\ntemperature optimum.\n\n\nThe temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also\n\n\ndepends on the habitat that they are adapted to. Tropical plants have a\n\n\nhigher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate\n\n\nclimates.\n\n\n11.10.4\n \nWater\n\n\nEven though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of\n\n\nwater as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly\n\n\non photosynthesis. Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing\n\n\nthe CO\n2\n \navailability.

During this process carbon\n\n\ndioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for\n\n\nmaking carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place\n\n\nonly in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the\n\n\nmesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO\n2\n\n\nfixation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction,\n\n\nwhile the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two\n\n\nstages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the\n\n\nlight energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to\n\n\nspecial chlorophyll\n \na\n \nmolecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two\n\n\nphotosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll\n \na\n \nP700\n\n\nmolecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs\n\n\nred light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred\n\n\nthrough PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a\n\n\nproton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid.

We must\n\n\nremember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs\n\n\nphotosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often\n\n\nlocated in the superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis. Hence, even\n\n\nin green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green,\n\n\nneed food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-\n\n\ngreen parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants\n\n\nR\nESPIRATION\n \nIN\n \nP\nLANTS\n\n\nC\nHAPTER\n \n12\n\n\n12.1 Do Plants\n\n\nBreathe?\n\n\n12.2 Glycolysis\n\n\n12.3 Fermentation\n\n\n12.4 Aerobic\n\n\nRespiration\n\n\n12.5 The\n\n\nRespiratory\n\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n\n12.6 Amphibolic\n\n\nPathway\n\n\n12.7 Respiratory\n\n\nQuotient\nRationalised 2023-24","154\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ndirectly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are\n\n\ndependent on dead and decaying matter. What is important to recognise\n\n\nis that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from\n\n\nphotosynthesis. This chapter deals with\n \ncellular respiration\n \nor the\n\n\nmechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release\n\n\nenergy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.\n\n\nPhotosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the\n\n\neukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy\n\n\ntakes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria\n \n(also only in\n\n\neukaryotes).\n \nThe breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds\n\n\nthrough oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable\n\n\namount of energy is called\n \nrespiration\n. The compounds that are oxidised\n\n\nduring this process are known as\n \nrespiratory substrates.\n \nUsually\n\n\ncarbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even\n\n\norganic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under\n\n\ncertain conditions. During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained\n\n\nin respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single\n\n\nstep. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by\n\n\nenzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP. Hence,\n\n\nit is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in\n\n\nrespiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to\n\n\nsynthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy\n\n\nneeds to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell.\n\n\nThis energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring\n\n\nprocesses of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during\n\n\nrespiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in\n\n\nthe cell.\n\n\n12.1\n \nD\nO\n \nP\nLANTS\n \nB\nREATHE\n?\n\n\nWell, the answer to this question is not quite so direct. Yes, plants require\n\n\nO\n2\n \nfor respiration to occur and they also give out CO\n2\n. Hence, plants have\n\n\nsystems in place that ensure the availability of O\n2\n. Plants, unlike animals,\n\n\nhave no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata\n\n\nand lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can\n\n\nget along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of\n\n\nits own gas-exchange needs. There is very little transport of gases from\n\n\none plant part to another. Second, plants do not present great demands\n\n\nfor gas exchange. Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than\n\n\nanimals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases\n\n\nexchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs\n\n\nduring these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O\n2\n \nis not\n\n\na problem in these cells since O\n2\n \nis released within the cell.\n \nThird, the\nRationalised 2023-24","R\nESPIRATION\n \nIN\n \nP\nLANTS\n \n155\n\n\ndistance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great.\n\n\nEach living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant.\n\n\n‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems\n\n\nand roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside\n\n\nand beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells\n\n\nin the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most\n\n\ncells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This\n\n\nis also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems\n\n\nand roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.\n\n\nThe complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO\n2\n \nand H\n2\nO\n\n\nas end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.\n\n\nC H\n \nO\n \nO\n \nCO\n \nH O\n \nEnergy\n6\n \n12\n \n6\n \n2\n \n2\n \n2\n6\n \n6\n \n6\n+\n \n\n \n→\n\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\nIf this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to\n\n\nsynthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the\n\n\nplant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that\n\n\nnot all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose\n\n\nnot in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just\n\n\nlarge enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP\n\n\nsynthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration.\n\n\nDuring the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon\n\n\ndioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion\n\n\nreaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may\n\n\nnot be available.\n \nCan you think of such situations (and organisms) where\n\n\nO\n2\n \nis not available?\n \nThere are sufficient reasons to believe that the first\n\n\ncells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.\n \nEven\n\n\namong present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted\n\n\nto anaerobic conditions.\n \nSome of these organisms are facultative\n\n\nanaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is\n\n\nobligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery\n\n\nto partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown\n\n\nof glucose to pyruvic acid is called\n \nglycolysis.\n\n\n12.2\n \nG\nLYCOLYSIS\n\n\nThe term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words,\n \nglycos\n \nfor sugar,\n\n\nand\n \nlysis\n \nfor splitting.\n \nThe scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav\n\n\nEmbden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the\n\n\nEMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.\n\n\nGlycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living\n\n\norganisms. In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form\n\n\ntwo molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from\n\n\nsucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage\nRationalised 2023-24","156\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ncarbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose\n\n\nand fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these\n\n\ntwo monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic\n\n\npathway.\n \nGlucose\n \nand\n \nfructose\n \nare\n\n\nphosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-\n\n\nphosphate by the activity of the enzyme\n\n\nhexokinase. This phosphorylated form of\n\n\nglucose then isomerises to produce fructose-6-\n\n\nphosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of\n\n\nglucose and fructose are same.\n \nThe various\n\n\nsteps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 12.1.\n\n\nIn glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the\n\n\ncontrol of different enzymes, takes place to\n\n\nproduce pyruvate from glucose. While studying\n\n\nthe steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at\n\n\nwhich utilisation or synthesis of ATP or (in this\n\n\ncase) NADH + H\n+\n \ntake place.\n\n\nATP is utilised at two steps: first in the\n\n\nconversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate\n\n\nand second in the conversion of fructose\n\n\n6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.\n\n\nThe fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split\n\n\ninto\n \ndihydroxyacetone\n \nphosphate\n \nand\n\n\n3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find\n\n\nthat there is one step where NADH + H\n+\n \nis\n\n\nformed\n \nfrom\n \nNAD\n+\n \n;\n \nthis\n \nis\n \nwhen\n\n\n3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted\n\n\nto 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA).\n \nTwo\n\n\nredox-equivalents are removed (in the form of\n\n\ntwo hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred\n\n\nto a molecule of NAD\n+\n. PGAL is oxidised and\n\n\nwith inorganic phosphate to get converted into\n\n\nBPGA.\n \nThe\n \nconversion\n \nof\n \nBPGA\n \nto\n\n\n3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy\n\n\nyielding process; this energy is trapped by the\n\n\nformation of ATP.

Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP molecules\n\n\nduring aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.\n\n\nFigure 12.5\n \nDiagramatic presentation of ATP\n\n\nsynthesis in mitochondria\nRationalised 2023-24","162\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nNow let us compare fermentation and aerobic respiration:\n\n\n•\n \nFermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose\n\n\nwhereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO\n2\n \nand\n\n\nH\n2\nO.\n\n\n•\n \nIn fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for\n\n\neach molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many\n\n\nmore molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions.\n\n\n•\n \nNADH is oxidised to NAD\n+\n \nrather slowly in fermentation, however\n\n\nthe reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration.\n\n\n12.6\n \nA\nMPHIBOLIC\n \nP\nATHWAY\n\n\nGlucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are\n\n\nusually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration.\n\n\nOther substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but\n\n\nthen they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure\n\n\n12.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory\n\n\npathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids\n\n\nfirst. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to\n\n\nacetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway\n\n\nafter being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by\n\n\nproteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending\n\n\non their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’\n\n\ncycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.\n\n\nSince respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory\n\n\nprocess has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the\n\n\nrespiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway.\n \nBut is this understanding\n\n\ncorrect?\n \nWe have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory\n\n\npathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and\n\n\nused to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very\n\n\ncompounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the\n\n\nsynthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down\n\n\nto acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a\n\n\nsubstrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl\n\n\nCoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the\n\n\nrespiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and\n\n\nsynthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of\n\n\nprotein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down\n\n\nprocesses within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is\n\n\nanabolism. Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism\n\n\nand catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway\n\n\nas an\n \namphibolic pathway\n \nrather than as a catabolic one.\nRationalised 2023-24","R\nESPIRATION\n \nIN\n \nP\nLANTS\n \n163\n\n\n12.7\n \nR\nESPIRATORY\n \nQ\nUOTIENT\n\n\nLet us now look at another aspect of respiration.

Almost all living cells\n\n\nin a plant have their surfaces exposed to air.\n\n\nThe breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells\n\n\nleading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the\n\n\nfavoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to\n\n\nyield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm.\n\n\nEach glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions\n\n\ninto two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the\n\n\npyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism.

Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots,\n\n\nstems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly\n\n\nsequence? You are, by now, aware of the terms seed, seedling, plantlet,\n\n\nmature plant. You have also seen that trees continue to increase in height\n\n\nor girth over a period of time. However, the leaves, flowers and fruits of the\n\n\nsame tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall\n\n\nperiodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede\n\n\nflowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is\n\n\nthere any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ\n\n\nand the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these\n\n\nbe altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question\n\n\nis, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional\n\n\nattributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and\n\n\ndifferentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the\n\n\ndevelopment of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise\n\n\nand highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex\n\n\nbody organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers,\n\n\nfruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 13.1). The first step in the\n\n\nprocess of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when\n\n\nfavourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of\n\n\nsuch favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a\n\n\nperiod of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return,\n\n\nthe seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place.\n\n\nIn this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which\n\n\ngovern and control these developmental processes.

What is growth? Growth can be defined\n\n\nas an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or\n\n\neven of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic\n\n\nprocesses (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of\n\n\nenergy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would\n\n\nyou describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water?\n\n\n13.1.1\n \nPlant Growth Generally is Indeterminate\n\n\nPlant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited\n\n\ngrowth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence\n\n\nof meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems\n\n\nhave the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however,\n\n\nsoon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body.\n\n\nThis form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the\n\n\nplant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth.\n\n\nWhat would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever\n\n\nhappen?\n\n\nIn earlier classes, you have studied about the root apical meristem\n\n\nand the shoot apical meristem.

You also know that in dicotyledonous\n\n\nplants and gymnosperms, the lateral meristems,\n\n\nvascular cambium and cork-cambium appear\n\n\nlater in life. These are the meristems that cause\n\n\nthe increase in the girth of the organs in which\n\n\nthey are active. This is known as secondary\n\n\ngrowth of the plant (see Figure 13.2).\n\n\n13.1.2 Growth is Measurable\n\n\nGrowth, at a cellular level, is principally a\n\n\nconsequence of increase in the amount of\n\n\nprotoplasm. Since increase in protoplasm is\n\n\ndifficult to measure directly, one generally\n\n\nmeasures some quantity which is more or less\n\n\nproportional\n \nto\n \nit.\n \nGrowth\n \nis,\n \ntherefore,\n\n\nmeasured by a variety of parameters some of\n\n\nwhich are: increase in fresh weight, dry weight,\n\n\nlength, area, volume and cell number. You may\n\n\nfind it amazing to know that one single maize\n\n\nroot apical mersitem can give rise to more than\n\n\n17,500 new cells per hour, whereas cells in a\n\n\nwatermelon may increase in size by upto\n\n\n3,50,000 times. In the former, growth is\n\n\nexpressed as increase in cell number; the latter\n\n\nexpresses growth as increase in size of the cell.\n\n\nWhile the growth of a pollen tube is measured\n\n\nin terms of its length, an increase in surface area\n\n\ndenotes the growth in a dorsiventral leaf.\n\n\n13.1.3 Phases of Growth\n\n\nThe period of growth is generally divided into\n\n\nthree phases, namely, meristematic, elongation\n\n\nand\n \nmaturation\n \n(Figure\n \n13.3).\n \nLet\n \nus\n\n\nunderstand this by looking at the root tips.

In most systems, the initial growth is slow\n\n\n(lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter – at\n\n\nan exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here,\n\n\nboth the progeny cells following mitotic cell division\n\n\nretain the ability to divide and continue to do so.\n\n\nHowever, with limited nutrient supply, the growth\n\n\nslows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot\n\n\nthe parameter of growth against time, we get a typical\n\n\nsigmoid or S-curve (Figure 13.6). A sigmoid curve\n\n\nis a characteristic of living organism growing in a\n\n\nnatural environment.

This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential\n\n\nelements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which\n\n\nin turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus,\n\n\nplant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water\n\n\nstatus of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities\n\n\nneeded for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential\n\n\nfor growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are\n\n\nrequired by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of\n\n\nenergy.\n\n\nIn addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range\n\n\nbest suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be\n\n\ndetrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity\n\n\nalso affect certain phases/stages of growth.\n\n\nFigure13.7\n \nDiagrammatic comparison of absolute and relative growth rates.

This act\n\n\nleading to maturation is termed as\n \ndifferentiation\n. During differentiation,\n\n\ncells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and\n\n\nprotoplasm.

Plant growth regulators are variously\n\n\ndescribed as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones\n\n\nin literature.\n\n\nThe PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their\n\n\nfunctions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth\n\n\npromoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern\n\n\nformation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting and seed formation. These\n\n\nare also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and\n\n\ncytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant\n\n\nresponses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are\n\n\nalso involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy\n\n\nand abscission. The PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group.

It is synthesised in large amounts\n\n\nby tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of\n\n\nethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of\n\n\nthe axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes\n\n\nsenescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and\n\n\nflowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the\n\n\nrespiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of\n\n\nrespiration is called respiratory climactic.\n\n\nEthylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in\n\n\npeanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid\n\n\ninternode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/\n\n\nupper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes\n\n\nroot growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase\n\n\ntheir absorption surface.\n\n\nEthylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set\n\n\nin pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates\n\n\nso many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in\n\n\nagriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is\n\n\nethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and\n\n\ntransported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon\n\n\nhastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission\n\n\nin flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female\n\n\nflowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield.\n\n\n13.4.3.5\n13.4.3.5\n13.4.3.5\n13.4.3.5\n13.4.3.5 Abscisic acid\nAbscisic acid\nAbscisic acid\nAbscisic acid\nAbscisic acid\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier,\n \nabscisic acid\n \n(ABA)\n \nwas discovered for its role in\n\n\nregulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has\n\n\nother wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a\n\n\ngeneral plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism.\n\n\nABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata\n\n\nand increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses.\n\n\nTherefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important\nRationalised 2023-24","178\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nrole in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing\n\n\ndormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors\n\n\nunfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist\n\n\nto GAs.\n\n\nWe may summarise that for any and every phase of growth,\n\n\ndifferentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some\n\n\nrole to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These\n\n\ncould be individualistic or synergistic.\n\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where\n\n\nmore than one PGR interact to affect that event, e.g., dormancy in seeds/\n\n\nbuds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc.\n\n\nRemember, the role of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control.\n\n\nAlong with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important\n\n\nrole in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such\n\n\nas temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR.\n\n\nSome of such events could be: vernalisation, flowering, dormancy, seed\n\n\ngermination, plant movements, etc.\n\n\nWe shall discuss briefly the role of light and temperature (both of them,\n\n\nthe extrinsic factors) on initiation of flowering.\n\n\nS\nUMMARY\n\n\nGrowth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is\n\n\nan irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length,\n\n\nheight, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased\n\n\nprotoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root\n\n\nand shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem,\n\n\ncontribute to the elongation growth of plant axes. Growth is indeterminate\n\n\nin higher plants. Following cell division in root and shoot apical meristem\n\n\ncells, the growth could be arithmetic or geometrical. Growth may not be\n\n\nand generally is not sustained at a high rate throughout the life of cell/\n\n\ntissue/organ/organism. One can define three principle phases of growth\n\n\n– the lag, the log and the senescent phase. When a cell loses the capacity\n\n\nto divide, it leads to differentiation. Differentiation results in development\n\n\nof structures that is commensurate with the function the cells finally has\n\n\nto perform. General principles for differentiation for cell, tissues and organs\n\n\nare similar. A differentiated cell may dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate.\n\n\nSince differentiation in plants is open, the development could also be\n\n\nflexible, i.e., the development is the sum of growth and differentiation.\n\n\nPlant exhibit plasticity in development.\nRationalised 2023-24","P\nLANT\n \nG\nROWTH\n \nAND\n \nD\nEVELOPMENT\n \n179\n\n\nPlant growth and development are under the control of both intrinsic\n\n\nand extrinsic factors.

Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O\n2\n \nand CO\n2\n\n\nbetween blood and atmospheric air.\n\n\nThe lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically\n\n\nan air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the\n\n\nvertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on\n\n\nthe lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of\n\n\nlungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic\n\n\ncavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity.

Inspiration\n\n\ncan occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is\n\n\nless than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in\n\n\nthe lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes\n\n\nplace when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric\n\n\npressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and\n\n\ninternal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients.\n\n\nInspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases\n\n\nthe volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The\n\n\ncontraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the\nRationalised 2023-24","186\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nsternum causing an increase in the volume of\n\n\nthe thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis.\n\n\nThe overall increase in the thoracic volume\n\n\ncauses a similar increase in pulmonary\n\n\nvolume. An increase in pulmonary volume\n\n\ndecreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less\n\n\nthan the atmospheric pressure which forces\n\n\nthe air from outside to move into the lungs,\n\n\ni.e., inspiration (Figure 14.2a). Relaxation of\n\n\nthe diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles\n\n\nreturns the diaphragm and sternum to their\n\n\nnormal positions and reduce the thoracic\n\n\nvolume and thereby the pulmonary volume.\n\n\nThis leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary\n\n\npressure to slightly above the atmospheric\n\n\npressure causing the expulsion of air from the\n\n\nlungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 14.2b).

Another centre present in the pons region of the brain\n\n\ncalled pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory\n\n\nrhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of\n\n\ninspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area\n\n\nis situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO\n2\n\n\nand hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre,\n\n\nwhich in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments\n\n\nin the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.\n\n\nReceptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise\n\n\nchanges in CO\n2\n \nand H\n+\n \nconcentration and send necessary signals to the\n\n\nrhythm centre for remedial actions.

Animals have evolved different mechanisms\n\n\nfor the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from\n\n\nthere. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and\n\n\nassociated air passages to perform this function.\n\n\nThe first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in\n\n\n(inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O\n2\n \nand\n\n\nCO\n2\n \nbetween deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout\n\n\nthe body by blood, exchange of O\n2\n \nand CO\n2\n \nbetween the oxygenated blood and\n\n\ntissues and utilisation of O\n2\n \nby the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps\n\n\ninvolved.\n\n\nInspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients\n\n\nbetween the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles –\n\n\nintercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be\n\n\nestimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.\n\n\nExchange of O\n2\n \nand CO\n2\n \nat the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of\n\n\ndiffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O\n2\n \n(pO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n \n(pCO\n2\n),\n\n\ntheir solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in\n\n\nour body facilitate diffusion of O\n2\n \nfrom the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as\n\n\nwell as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the\n\n\ndiffusion of CO\n2\n \nin the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.\n\n\nOxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO\n2\n \nis\n\n\nhigher, O\n2\n \ngets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues\n\n\nwhere pO\n2\n \nis low and pCO\n2\n \nand H\n+\n \nconcentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of\n\n\ncarbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO\n3\n\n\n–\n) with the help of the enzyme\n\n\ncarbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin\n\n\nas carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO\n2\n \nis high, it gets bound to\n\n\nblood whereas in the alveoli where pCO\n2\n \nis low and pO\n2\n \nis high, it gets removed\n\n\nfrom the blood.\n\n\nRespiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla\n\n\nregion of brain.

They have a red coloured, iron containing\n\n\ncomplex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these\n\n\ncells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every\n\n\n100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of\n\n\nrespiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which\n\n\nthey are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs).\n\n\nLeucocytes\n \nare also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are\n\n\ncolourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are\n\n\nrelatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm\n–3\n \nof blood.\n\n\nLeucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs\n\n\n– granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils\n\n\nare different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes\n\n\nare the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65\n\n\nper cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent)\n\n\namong them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic\n\n\ncells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete\n\n\nhistamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory\n\n\nreactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also\n\n\nR B C\n\n\nPlatelets\n\n\nEosinophil\n\n\nBasophil\n\n\nNeutrophil\n\n\nMonocyte\n\n\nT lymphocyte\n\n\nB lymphocyte\n\n\nFigure 15.1\n \nDiagrammatic representation of formed elements in blood\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nODY\n \nF\nLUIDS\n \nAND\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n \n195\n\n\nassociated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of\n\n\ntwo major types – ‘B’ and ‘T’ forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are\n\n\nresponsible for immune responses of the body.\n\n\nPlatelets also called\n \nthrombocytes\n, are cell fragments produced from\n\n\nmegakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally\n\n\ncontains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm\n–3\n. Platelets can release a variety\n\n\nof substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of\n\n\nblood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which\n\n\nwill lead to excessive loss of blood from the body.\n\n\n15.1.3 Blood Groups\n\n\nAs you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it\n\n\nappears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done.\n\n\nTwo such groupings – the ABO and Rh – are widely used all over the\n\n\nworld.\n\n\n15.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n15.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n15.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n15.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n15.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n\n\nABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens\n\n\n(chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A\n\n\nand B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural\n\n\nantibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution\n\n\nof antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood,\n \nA, B, AB\n \nand\n \nO\n\n\nare given in Table 15.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion,\n\n\nany blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched\n\n\nwith the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe\n\n\nproblems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is\n\n\nalso shown in the Table 15.1.\n\n\nBlood Group\n \nAntigens on\n \nAntibodies\n \nDonor’s Group\n\n\nRBCs\n \nin Plasma\n\n\nA\n \nA\n \nanti-B\n \nA, O\n\n\nB\n \nB\n \nanti-A\n \nB, O\n\n\nAB\n \nA, B\n \nnil\n \nAB, A, B, O\n\n\nO\n \nnil\n \nanti-A, B\n \nO\n\n\nT\nABLE\n \n15.1\n \nBlood Groups and Donor Compatibility\n\n\nFrom the above mentioned table it is evident that group ‘O’ blood can\n\n\nbe donated to persons with any other blood group and hence ‘O’ group\n\n\nindividuals are called ‘universal donors’. Persons with ‘AB’ group can\n\n\naccept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood.\n\n\nTherefore, such persons are called ‘universal recipients’.\nRationalised 2023-24","196\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n15.1.3.2\n15.1.3.2\n15.1.3.2\n15.1.3.2\n15.1.3.2\n \nRh grouping\nRh grouping\nRh grouping\nRh grouping\nRh grouping\n\n\nAnother antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys\n\n\n(hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80\n\n\nper cent) of humans. Such individuals are called\n \nRh positive\n \n(Rh+ve)\n\n\nand those in whom this antigen is absent are called\n \nRh negative\n \n(Rh-ve).\n\n\nAn Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies\n\n\nagainst the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched\n\n\nbefore transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching)\n\n\nhas been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with\n\n\nRh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to\n\n\nthe Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy as the two bloods are\n\n\nwell separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the first\n\n\nchild, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small\n\n\namounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother\n\n\nstarts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of\n\n\nher subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve)\n\n\ncan leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs.\n\n\nThis could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and\n\n\njaundice to the baby. This condition is called\n \nerythroblastosis foetalis\n.\n\n\nThis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother\n\n\nimmediately after the delivery of the first child.\n\n\n15.1.4 Coagulation of Blood\n\n\nYou know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound\n\n\ndoes not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing\n\n\nafter sometime.\n \nDo you know why?\n \nBlood exhibits coagulation or clotting\n\n\nin response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent\n\n\nexcessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark\n\n\nreddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period\n\n\nof time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads\n\n\ncalled fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are\n\n\ntrapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in\n\n\nthe plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from\n\n\nanother inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An\n\n\nenzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This\n\n\ncomplex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade\n\n\nprocess) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive\n\n\nstate. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release\n\n\ncertain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain\n\n\nfactors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate\n\n\ncoagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting.\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nODY\n \nF\nLUIDS\n \nAND\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n \n197\n\n\n15.2\n \nL\nYMPH\n \n(T\nISSUE\n \nF\nLUID\n)\n\n\nAs the blood passes through the capillaries in tissues, some water along\n\n\nwith many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces\n\n\nbetween the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the\n\n\nformed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the\n\n\ninterstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as\n\n\nthat in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and\n\n\nthe cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels\n\n\ncalled the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the\n\n\nmajor veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph.\n\n\nLymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which\n\n\nare responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an\n\n\nimportant carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through\n\n\nlymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi.\n\n\n15.3\n \nC\nIRCULATORY\n \nP\nATHWAYS\n\n\nThe circulatory patterns are of two types – open or closed.\n \nOpen\n\n\ncirculatory system\n \nis present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood\n\n\npumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or\n\n\nbody cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a\n \nclosed\n\n\ncirculatory system\n \nin which the blood pumped by the heart is always\n\n\ncirculated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is\n\n\nconsidered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be\n \nmore\n\n\nprecisely regulated.\n\n\nAll vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a\n\n\n2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the\n\n\nreptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a\n\n\nsingle ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a\n\n\n4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In fishes the heart\n\n\npumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and\n\n\nsupplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to\n\n\nthe heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium\n\n\nreceives oxygenated blood from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium\n\n\ngets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed\n\n\nup in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double\n\n\ncirculation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood\n\n\nreceived by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of\n\n\nthe same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two\n\n\nseparate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these\n\n\nanimals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory\n\n\nsystem.\nRationalised 2023-24","198\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n15.3.1 Human Circulatory System\n\n\nHuman circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists\n\n\nof a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood\n\n\nvessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated.\n\n\nHeart,\n \nthe mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic\n\n\ncavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of\n\n\na clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag,\n\n\npericardium,\n \nenclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four\n\n\nchambers, two relatively small upper chambers called\n \natria\n \nand two larger\n\n\nlower chambers called\n \nventricles\n. A thin, muscular wall called the inter-\n\n\natrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled,\n\n\nthe inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles\n\n\n(Figure 15.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also\n\n\nseparated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum.\n\n\nHowever, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which\n\n\nthe two chambers of the same side are connected. The opening between\n\n\nthe right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of\n\n\nthree muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid\n\n\nor mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left\n\n\nventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the\n\n\nFigure 15.2\n \nSection of a human heart\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nODY\n \nF\nLUIDS\n \nAND\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n \n199\n\n\npulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the\n\n\nsemilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in\n\n\none direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles\n\n\nto the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward\n\n\nflow.\n\n\nThe entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles\n\n\nare much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature\n\n\ncalled the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 15.2). A\n\n\npatch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium\n\n\ncalled the\n \nsino-atrial node\n \n(SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in\n\n\nthe lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum\n\n\ncalled the\n \natrio-ventricular node\n \n(AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio-\n\n\nventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes\n\n\nthrough the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter-\n\n\nventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle.\n\n\nThese branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular\n\n\nmusculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The\n\n\nnodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without\n\n\nany external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action\n\n\npotentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of\n\n\nthe nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action\n\n\npotentials, i.e., 70-75 min\n–1\n,\n \nand is responsible for initiating and\n\n\nmaintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is\n\n\ncalled the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute\n\n\n(average 72 beats min\n–1\n).\n\n\n15.3.2 Cardiac Cycle\n\n\nHow does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the\n\n\nfour chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in\n \njoint\n\n\ndiastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the\n\n\npulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle\n\n\nrespectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are\n\n\nclosed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which\n\n\nstimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the\n\n\natrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about\n\n\n30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by\n\n\nthe AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through\n\n\nthe entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles\n\n\nto contract,\n \n(ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation\n\n\n(diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole\n\n\nincreases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and\nRationalised 2023-24","200\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nbicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As\n\n\nthe ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding\n\n\nthe pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open,\n\n\nallowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into\n\n\nthe circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole)\n\n\nand the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves\n\n\nwhich prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the\n\n\nventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves\n\n\nare pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which\n\n\nwas being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again\n\n\nmoves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in\n\n\na relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new\n\n\naction potential and the events described above are repeated in that\n\n\nsequence and the process continues.\n\n\nThis sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called\n\n\nthe cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria\n\n\nand ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times per minute,\n\n\ni.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could\n\n\nbe deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a\n\n\ncardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood\n\n\nwhich is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the\n\n\nheart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the\n\n\ncardiac output can be defined as the volume of blood pumped out by each\n\n\nventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual.\n\n\nThe body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate\n\n\nand thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an\n\n\nathlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man.\n\n\nDuring each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which\n\n\ncan be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is\n\n\nassociated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas\n\n\nthe second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the\n\n\nsemilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic significance.\n\n\n15.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG)\n\n\nYou are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television\n\n\nshow: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage\n\n\ntraces on a screen and makes the sound “... pip... pip... pip.....\n\n\npeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type\n\n\nof machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram\n\n\n(ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the\n\n\nheart during a cardiac cycle. To obtain a standard ECG (as shown in the\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nODY\n \nF\nLUIDS\n \nAND\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n \n201\n\n\nFigure 15.3), a patient is connected to the\n\n\nmachine with three electrical leads (one to each\n\n\nwrist and to the left ankle) that continuously\n\n\nmonitor the heart activity. For a detailed\n\n\nevaluation of the heart’s function, multiple\n\n\nleads are attached to the chest region. Here,\n\n\nwe will talk only about a standard ECG.\n\n\nEach peak in the ECG is identified with a\n\n\nletter from P to T that corresponds to a specific\n\n\nelectrical activity of the heart.\n\n\nThe P-wave represents the electrical\n\n\nexcitation (or depolarisation) of the atria\n,\n\n\nwhich leads to the contraction of both the atria.\n\n\nThe QRS complex represents the\n \ndepolarisation of the ventricles\n,\n\n\nwhich initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly\n\n\nafter Q and marks the beginning of the systole.\n\n\nThe T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal\n\n\nstate (\nrepolarisation\n). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole.\n\n\nObviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a\n\n\ngiven time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual.\n\n\nSince the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same\n\n\nshape for a given lead configuration, any deviation from this shape indicates\n\n\na possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical significance.\n\n\n15.4\n \nD\nOUBLE\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n\n\nThe blood flows strictly by a fixed route through\n \nBlood Vessels\n—the\n\n\narteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers:\n\n\nan inner lining of squamous endothelium, the\n \ntunica intima\n, a middle\n\n\nlayer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an\n\n\nexternal layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres, the\n \ntunica\n\n\nexterna\n. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure\n\n\n15.4).\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters\n\n\nthe pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the\n\n\naorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is\n\n\npassed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by\n\n\nthe pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the\n\n\npulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is\n\n\ncarried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues\n\n\nfrom where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules,\n\n\nveins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the\n\n\nsystemic circulation (Figure 15.4).\n \nThe systemic circulation provides\n\n\nnutrients, O\n2\n \nand other essential substances to the tissues and takes\n\n\nCO\n2\n \nand other harmful substances away for elimination. A unique\n\n\nvascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called\n\n\nFigure 15.3\n \nDiagrammatic presentation of a\n\n\nstandard ECG\nRationalised 2023-24","202\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nhepatic portal system. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from intestine\n\n\nto the liver before it is delivered to the systemic circulation. A special\n\n\ncoronary system of blood vessels is present in our body exclusively for\n\n\nthe circulation of blood to and from the cardiac musculature.\n\n\n15.5\n \nR\nEGULATION\n \nOF\n \nC\nARDIAC\n \nA\nCTIVITY\n\n\nNormal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated\n\n\nby specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic.\n\n\nA special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac\n\n\nfunction through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through\n\n\nthe sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat,\n\n\nthe strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output.\n\n\nOn the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component\n\n\nof ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action\n\n\npotential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones\n\n\ncan also increase the cardiac output.\n\n\n15.6\n \nD\nISORDERS\n \nOF\n \nC\nIRCULATORY\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nHigh Blood Pressure (Hypertension):\n \nHypertension is the term for\n\n\nblood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement\n\n\n120 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping,\n\n\npressure and 80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated\n\n\nchecks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or\n\n\nFigure 15.4\n \nSchematic plan of blood circulation in human\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nODY\n \nF\nLUIDS\n \nAND\n \nC\nIRCULATION\n \n203\n\n\nhigher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases\n\n\nand also affects vital organs like brain and kidney.\n\n\nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD):\n \nCoronary Artery Disease, often referred\n\n\nto as\n \natherosclerosis\n, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart\n\n\nmuscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous\n\n\ntissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower.\n\n\nAngina:\n \nIt is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain\n\n\nappears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina\n\n\ncan occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among\n\n\nthe middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the\n\n\nblood flow.\n\n\nHeart Failure:\n \nHeart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping\n\n\nblood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes\n\n\ncalled congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of\n\n\nthe main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac\n\n\narrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart\n\n\nmuscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply).\n\n\nS\nUMMARY\n\n\nVertebrates circulate blood, a fluid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential\n\n\nsubstances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another fluid, lymph\n\n\n(tissue fluid) is also used for the transport of certain substances.\n\n\nBlood comprises of a fluid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs,\n\n\nerythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute\n\n\nthe formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and O systems based\n\n\non the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood\n\n\ngrouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus\n\n\nfactor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a fluid\n\n\nderived from blood called tissue fluid. This fluid called lymph is almost similar to blood\n\n\nexcept for the protein content and the formed elements.\n\n\nAll vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory\n\n\nsystem consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a fluid, blood.\n\n\nHeart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node\n\n\n(SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75/min) and\n\n\ntherefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The\n\n\naction potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed\n\n\nby their relaxation (diastole). The systole forces the blood to move from the atria to the ventricles\n\n\nand to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in\n\n\nthe heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72\n\n\nsuch cycles per minute. About 70 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a\n\n\ncardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume.

These substances have\n\n\nto be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the\n\n\nmechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on\n\n\ncommon nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major\n\n\nforms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the\n\n\nmost toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination,\n\n\nwhereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum\n\n\nloss of water.\n\n\nThe process of excreting ammonia is\n \nAmmonotelism\n. Many bony fishes,\n\n\naquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are\n \nammonotelic\nammonotelic\nammonotelic\nammonotelic\nammonotelic\n \nin nature.\n\n\nAmmonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across\n\n\nbody surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneys\n\n\ndo not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation\n\n\nnecessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea\n\n\nand uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial\n\n\namphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called\n \nureotelic\nureotelic\nureotelic\nureotelic\nureotelic\n\n\nanimals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the\n\n\nliver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and\n\n\nexcreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the\n\n\nkidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity.\n\n\nReptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric\n\n\nacid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are\n\n\ncalled\n \nuricotelic\nuricotelic\nuricotelic\nuricotelic\nuricotelic\n \nanimals.\n\n\nE\nXCRETORY\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n \nAND\n\n\nTHEIR\n \nE\nLIMINATION\n\n\nC\nHAPTER\n \n16\n\n\n16.1 Human\n\n\nExcretory\n\n\nSystem\n\n\n16.2 Urine Formation\n\n\n16.3 Function of the\n\n\nTubules\n\n\n16.4 Mechanism of\n\n\nConcentration\n\n\nof the Filtrate\n\n\n16.5 Regulation of\n\n\nKidney Function\n\n\n16.6 Micturition\n\n\n16.7 Role of other\n\n\nOrgans in\n\n\nExcretion\n\n\n16.8 Disorders of the\n\n\nExcretory\n\n\nSystem\nRationalised 2023-24","206\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nA survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures.\n\n\nIn most of the invertebrates, these structures are simple tubular forms\n\n\nwhereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some\n\n\nof these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia\n \nor flame cells are\n\n\nthe excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g.,\n \nPlanaria\n),\n\n\nrotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate –\n \nAmphioxus\n.\n\n\nProtonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume\n\n\nregulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory\n\n\nstructures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove\n\n\nnitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian\n\n\ntubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including\n\n\ncockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous\n\n\nwastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform\n\n\nthe excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.\n\n\n16.1 H\nUMAN\n \nE\nXCRETORY\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nIn humans, the excretory system consists\n\n\nof a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a\n\n\nurinary bladder and a urethra (Figure\n\n\n16.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean\n\n\nshaped structures situated between the\n\n\nlevels of last thoracic and third lumbar\n\n\nvertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of\n\n\nthe abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an\n\n\nadult human measures 10-12 cm in\n\n\nlength, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in\n\n\nthickness with an average weight of 120-\n\n\n170 g. Towards the centre of the inner\n\n\nconcave surface of the kidney is a notch\n\n\ncalled hilum through which ureter, blood\n\n\nvessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum\n\n\nis a broad funnel shaped space called the\n\n\nrenal pelvis with projections called calyces.\n\n\nThe outer layer of kidney is a tough\n\n\ncapsule. Inside the kidney, there are two\n\n\nzones, an outer\n \ncortex\n \nand an inner\n\n\nmedulla\n. The medulla is divided into a few\n\n\nconical masses (medullary pyramids)\n\n\nprojecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx).\n\n\nThe\n \ncortex\n \nextends\n \nin\n \nbetween\n \nthe\n\n\nFigure 16.1\n \nHuman Urinary system\nRationalised 2023-24","E\nXCRETORY\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n \nAND\n \nTHEIR\n \nE\nLIMINATION\n \n207\n\n\nFigure 16.3\n \nA diagrammatic representation of a nephron showing blood vessels,\n\n\nduct and tubule\n\n\nmedullary pyramids as renal columns called\n\n\nColumns of Bertini\n \n(Figure 16.2).\n\n\nEach kidney has nearly one million\n\n\ncomplex tubular structures called\n \nnephrons\n\n\n(Figure 16.3), which are the functional units.\n\n\nEach\n \nnephron\n \nhas\n \ntwo\n \nparts\n \n–\n \nthe\n\n\nglomerulus\n \nand\n \nthe\n \nrenal\n \ntubule.\n\n\nGlomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed by\n\n\nthe afferent arteriole – a fine branch of renal\n\n\nartery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried\n\n\naway by an efferent arteriole.\n\n\nThe renal tubule begins with a double\n\n\nwalled cup-like structure called\n \nBowman’s\n\n\ncapsule\n, which encloses the glomerulus.\n\n\nGlomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, is\n\n\ncalled\n \nthe\n \nmalpighian\n \nbody\n \nor\n \nrenal\n\n\ncorpuscle\n \n(Figure\n \n16.4).\n \nThe\n \ntubule\n\n\ncontinues further to form a highly coiled\n\n\nnetwork –\n \nproximal convoluted tubule\n\n\nFigure 16.2\n \nLongitudinal section (Diagrammatic)\n\n\nof Kidney\nRationalised 2023-24","208\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n(PCT).

The\n\n\nascending limb continues as another highly\n\n\ncoiled\n \ntubular\n \nregion\n \ncalled\n \ndistal\n\n\nconvoluted tubule\n \n(DCT). The DCTs of\n\n\nmany nephrons open into a straight tube\n\n\ncalled\n \ncollecting duct\n, many of which\n\n\nconverge and open into the renal pelvis\n\n\nthrough\n \nmedullary\n \npyramids\n \nin\n \nthe\n\n\ncalyces.\n\n\nThe Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and\n\n\nDCT of the nephron are situated in the\n\n\ncortical region of the kidney whereas the\n\n\nloop of Henle dips into the medulla. In\n\n\nmajority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is\n\n\ntoo short and extends only very little into\n\n\nthe medulla. Such nephrons are called\n\n\ncortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons,\n\n\nthe loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These\n\n\nnephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons.\n\n\nThe efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine\n\n\ncapillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular\n\n\ncapillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s\n\n\nloop forming a ‘U’ shaped\n \nvasa recta\n.\n \nVasa recta\n \nis absent or highly\n\n\nreduced in cortical nephrons.\n\n\n16.2\n \nU\nRINE\n \nF\nORMATION\n\n\nUrine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular\n\n\nfiltration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of\n\n\nthe nephron.\n\n\nThe first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried\n\n\nout by the glomerulus and is called\n \nglomerular filtration\n. On an average,\n\n\n1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute\n\n\nroughly 1/5\nth\n \nof the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a\n\n\nminute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood\n\n\nthrough 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the\n\n\nepithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these\n\n\ntwo layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are\n\n\narranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called\n\n\nfiltration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these\n\n\nmembranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the\n\n\nproteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is\n\n\nconsidered as a process of\n \nultra filtration.\n\n\nAfferent arteriole\n\n\nEfferent\n\n\narteriole\n\n\nBowman’s\n\n\ncapsule\n\n\nProximal\n\n\nconvoluted tubule\n\n\nFigure 16.4\n \nMalpighian body (renal corpuscle)\nRationalised 2023-24","E\nXCRETORY\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n \nAND\n \nTHEIR\n \nE\nLIMINATION\n \n209\n\n\nThe amount of the filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute is called\n\n\nglomerular filtration rate\n \n(GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is\n\n\napproximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !\n\n\nThe kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular\n\n\nfiltration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxta\n\n\nglomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed by\n\n\ncellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent\n\n\narteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG\n\n\ncells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and\n\n\nthereby the GFR back to normal.\n\n\nA comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litres\n\n\nper day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99\n\n\nper cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This\n\n\nprocess is called\n \nreabsorption\n. The tubular epithelial cells in different\n\n\nsegments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms.\n\n\nFor example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na\n+\n, etc., in the filtrate\n\n\nare reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by\n\n\npassive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial\n\n\nsegments of the nephron (Figure 16.5).\n\n\nDuring urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H\n+\n,\n\n\nK\n+\n \nand ammonia into the filtrate. Tubular secretion is also an important\n\n\nstep in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid\n\n\nbase balance of body fluids.\n\n\n16.3\n \nF\nUNCTION\n \nOF\n \nTHE\n \nT\nUBULES\n\n\nProximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):\n \nPCT is lined by simple cuboidal\n\n\nbrush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.\n\n\nNearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes\n\n\nand water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintain\n\n\nthe pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of\n\n\nhydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption of\n\n\nHCO\n3\n\n\n–\n \nfrom it.\n\n\nHenle’s Loop:\n \nReabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.\n\n\nHowever, this region plays a significant role in the maintenance of high\n\n\nosmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb of loop of\n\n\nHenle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. This\n\n\nconcentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb is\n\n\nimpermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or\n\n\npassively. Therefore, as the concentrated filtrate pass upward, it gets\n\n\ndiluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.\n\n\nDistal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):\n \nConditional reabsorption of Na\n+\n\n\nand water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorption\n\n\nof HCO\n3\n\n\n–\n \nand selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and\n\n\nNH\n3\n \nto maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in blood.\nRationalised 2023-24","210\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nCollecting Duct:\n \nThis long duct extends from the cortex of the kidney\n\n\nto the inner parts of the medulla. Large amounts of water could be\n\n\nreabsorbed from this region to produce a concentrated urine. This segment\n\n\nallows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitium\n\n\nto keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH\n\n\nand ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H\n+\n \nand K\n+\n \nions\n\n\n(Figure 16.5).\n\n\n16.4\n \nM\nECHANISM\n \nOF\n \nC\nONCENTRATION\n \nOF\n \nTHE\n \nF\nILTRATE\n\n\nMammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’s\n\n\nloop and\n \nvasa recta\n \nplay a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in\n\n\nthe two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a\n\n\ncounter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of\n \nvasa recta\n \nis\n\n\nFigure 16.5\n \nReabsorption and secretion of major substances at different parts of\n\n\nthe nephron (Arrows indicate direction of movement of materials.)\nRationalised 2023-24","E\nXCRETORY\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n \nAND\n \nTHEIR\n \nE\nLIMINATION\n \n211\n\n\nalso in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop\n\n\nand\n \nvasa recta\n, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining\n\n\nan increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e.,\n\n\nfrom 300 mOsmolL\n–1\n \nin the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL\n–1\n \nin the inner\n\n\nmedulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is\n\n\ntransported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged\n\n\nwith the descending limb of\n \nvasa recta\n. NaCl is returned to the interstitium\n\n\nby the ascending portion of\n \nvasa recta\n. Similarly, small amounts of urea\n\n\nenter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is\n\n\ntransported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above\n\n\ndescribed transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement\n\n\nof Henle’s loop and\n \nvasa recta\n \nis called the\n \ncounter current mechanism\n\n\n(Figure. 16.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient\n\n\nFigure 16.6\n \nDiagrammatic representation of a nephron and\n \nvasa recta\n \nshowing\n\n\ncounter current mechanisms\nRationalised 2023-24","212\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nin the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps\n\n\nin an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby\n\n\nconcentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly\n\n\nfour times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.\n\n\n16.5\n \nR\nEGULATION\n \nOF\n \nK\nIDNEY\n \nF\nUNCTION\n\n\nThe functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by\n\n\nhormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and\n\n\nto a certain extent, the heart.\n\n\nOsmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume,\n\n\nbody fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from\n\n\nthe body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus\n\n\nto release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin\n \nfrom the\n\n\nneurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of\n\n\nthe tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume\n\n\ncan switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete\n\n\nthe feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory\n\n\neffects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An\n\n\nincrease in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and\n\n\nthereby the GFR.\n\n\nThe JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood\n\n\nflow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release\n\n\nrenin\n \nwhich converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and\n\n\nfurther\n \nto\n \nangiotensin\n \nII.\n \nAngiotensin\n \nII,\n \nbeing\n \na\n \npowerful\n\n\nvasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby\n\n\nGFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release\n\n\nAldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na\n+\n \nand water from\n\n\nthe distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood\n\n\npressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as\n\n\nthe\n \nRenin-Angiotensin\n \nmechanism.\n\n\nAn increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release\n\n\nof\n \nAtrial Natriuretic Factor\n \n(ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of\n\n\nblood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism,\n\n\ntherefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.\n\n\n16.6\n \nM\nICTURITION\n\n\nUrine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder\n\n\nwhere it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous\n\n\nsystem (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder\n\n\nas it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls\n\n\nof the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages\nRationalised 2023-24","E\nXCRETORY\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n \nAND\n \nTHEIR\n \nE\nLIMINATION\n \n213\n\n\nto initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and\n\n\nsimultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of\n\n\nurine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural\n\n\nmechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult human\n\n\nexcretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed\n\n\nis a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0)\n\n\nand has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is\n\n\nexcreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of\n\n\nurine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic\n\n\ndiscorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence\n\n\nof glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are\n\n\nindicative of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n16.7\n \nR\nOLE\n \nOF\n \nOTHER\n \nO\nRGANS\n \nIN\n \nE\nXCRETION\n\n\nOther than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the elimination\n\n\nof excretory wastes.\n\n\nOur lungs remove large amounts of CO\n2\n \n(approximately 200mL/\n\n\nminute) and also significant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largest\n\n\ngland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin,\n\n\nbiliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs.\n\n\nMost of these substances ultimately pass out alongwith digestive wastes.\n\n\nThe sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certain\n\n\nsubstances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat\n\n\nglands is a watery fluid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lactic\n\n\nacid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling\n\n\neffect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of the\n\n\nwastes\n \nmentioned\n \nabove.\n \nSebaceous\n \nglands\n \neliminate\n \ncertain\n\n\nsubstances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. This\n\n\nsecretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you know\n\n\nthat small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated through\n\n\nsaliva too?\n\n\n16.8\n \nD\nISORDERS\n \nOF\n \nTHE\n \nE\nXCRETORY\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nMalfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a\n\n\ncondition called\n \nuremia\n, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney\n\n\nfailure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called\n\n\nhemodialysis\n. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained\n\n\nfrom a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called\n \nartificial\n\n\nkidney\n. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing\n\n\nunit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled\n\n\ncellophane tube surrounded by a fluid (dialysing fluid) having the same\nRationalised 2023-24","214\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\nS\nUMMARY\n\n\nMany nitrogen containing substances, ions, CO\n2\n, water, etc., that accumulate in\n\n\nthe body have to be eliminated. Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and their\n\n\nexcretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability of\n\n\nwater). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.\n\n\nProtonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys are\n\n\nthe common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastes\n\n\nbut also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.\n\n\nIn humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters,\n\n\na urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structures\n\n\ncalled nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions –\n\n\nglomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferent\n\n\narterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walled\n\n\nBowman’s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule\n\n\n(PCT), Henle’s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many\n\n\nnephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into the\n\n\nrenal pelvis through the medullary pyramids. The Bowman’s capsule encloses the\n\n\nglomerulus to form Malpighian or renal corpuscle.\n\n\nUrine formation involves three main processes, i.e., filtration, reabsorption and\n\n\nsecretion. Filtration is a non-selective process performed by the glomerulus using\n\n\nthe glomerular capillary blood pressure. About 1200 ml of blood is filtered by the\n\n\nglomerulus per minute to form 125 ml of filtrate in the Bowman’s capsule per\n\n\ncomposition as that of plasma except the nitrogenous wastes.

Muscles have been classified using different criteria,\n\n\nnamely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their\n\n\nactivities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are\n\n\nidentified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac.\n\n\nSkeletal muscles\n \nare closely associated with the skeletal components\n\n\nof the body.

Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm\n\n\ncontains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic\n\n\nreticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A\n\n\ncharacteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number\n\n\nof parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or\n\n\nmyofibrils\n. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A\n\n\ndetailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance\n\n\nis due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins –\n \nActin\n \nand\n\n\nMyosin\n.

Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to\n\n\neach other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin\n\n\nfilaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are\n\n\ncommonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of\n\n\neach ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin\n\n\nfilaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the\n\n\n‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous\n\n\nmembrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately\n\n\nthroughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril\n\n\nbetween two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of\n\n\ncontraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 17.2). In a resting state, the\n\n\nedges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap\n\n\nthe free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick\n\n\nfilaments.

Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular\n\n\nhead with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy\n\n\nmeromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM).

A motor neuron alongwith the muscle\n\n\nfibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a\n\n\nmotor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the\n\n\nneuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching\n\n\nthis junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates\n\n\nan action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle\n\n\nfibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase\n\n\nin Ca\n++\n \nlevel leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on\n\n\nactin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.\n\n\nUtilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to\n\n\nthe exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 17.4).\n\n\nThis pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band.\n\n\nThe ‘Z’ line attached to these actins\n \nare also pulled inwards thereby causing\n\n\na shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above\n\n\nsteps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands\n\n\nget reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 17.5). The\n\n\nmyosin, releasing the ADP and P\n1\n \ngoes back to its relaxed state. A new\n\n\nATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 17.4). The ATP is again\n\n\nhydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation\n\n\nFigure 17.4\n \nStages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of\n\n\ncross bridge\nRationalised 2023-24","L\nOCOMOTION\n \nAND\n \nM\nOVEMENT\n \n223\n\n\nand breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues\n\n\ntill the Ca\n++\n \nions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting\n\n\nin the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back\n\n\nto their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres\n\n\ncan vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead\n\n\nto the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen\n\n\nin them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing\n\n\npigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the\n\n\nmuscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the\n\n\nRed fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can\n\n\nutilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production.\n\n\nThese muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the\n\n\nother hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin\n\n\nand therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number\n\n\nof mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic\n\n\nreticulum is high.

This type of joint is shown\n\n\nby the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous\n\n\nconnective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.\n\n\nIn\n \ncartilaginous joints,\n \nthe bones involved are joined together with\n\n\nthe help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the\n\n\nvertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.\n\n\nSynovial joints\n \nare characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial\n\n\ncavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement\n\n\nallows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many\n\n\nother movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral\n\n\ngirdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding\n\n\njoint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal\n\n\nof thumb) are some examples.\n\n\n17.5\n \nD\nISORDERS\n \nOF\n \nM\nUSCULAR\n \nAND\n \nS\nKELETAL\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nMyasthenia gravis:\n \nAuto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular\n\n\njunction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.\n\n\nMuscular dystrophy:\n \nProgressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly\n\n\ndue to genetic disorder.\n\n\nTetany:\n \nRapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca\n++\n \nin\n\n\nbody fluid.\n\n\nArthritis:\n \nInflammation of joints.\n\n\nOsteoporosis:\n \nAge-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass\n\n\nand increased chances of fractures.

Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary\n\n\nmovements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by\n\n\nanimals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is\nRationalised 2023-24","228\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ncalled locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding\n\n\nground, better climate or to protect themselves.\n\n\nThe cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular\n\n\nmovements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular\n\n\nactivities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are\n\n\nattached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature.\n\n\nVisceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and\n\n\ninvoluntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated,\n\n\nbranched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility\n\n\nand elasticity.\n\n\nMuscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many\n\n\nparallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged\n\n\nunits called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central\n\n\n‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin\n\n\nfilaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’ lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised\n\n\nproteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are\n\n\nmasked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding\n\n\nsites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre\n\n\nwhich generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca\n++\n \nfrom\n\n\nsarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca\n++\n \nactivates actin which binds to the myosin head to\n\n\nform a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to\n\n\nslide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca\n++\n \nare then\n\n\nreturned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are\n\n\nbroken and the muscles relax.\n\n\nRepeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as\n\n\nRed and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin\n\n\npigment in them.\n\n\nBones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is\n\n\ndivisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum\n\n\nconstitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular\n\n\nskeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and\n\n\ncartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable\n\n\nmovements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.\n\n\nE\nXERCISES\n\n\n1.

The PNS comprises of all the nerves\n\n\nof the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve\n\n\nfibres of the PNS are of two types :\n\n\n(a)\n \nafferent fibres\n\n\n(b)\n \nefferent fibres\n\n\nThe afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to\n\n\nthe CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the\n\n\nCNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.\n\n\nThe PNS is divided into two divisions called\n \nsomatic neural system\n\n\nand\n \nautonomic neural system\n. The somatic neural system relays\n\n\nimpulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural\n\n\nsystem transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and\n\n\nsmooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further\n\n\nclassified into\n \nsympathetic neural system\n \nand\n \nparasympathetic neural\n\n\nsystem\n.\n\n\nVisceral nervous system\n \nis the part of the peripheral nervous system\n\n\nthat comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexuses\n\n\nby which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera\n\n\nand from the viscera to the central nervous system.\n\n\n18.3\n \nN\nEURON\n \nAS\n \nS\nTRUCTURAL\n \nAND\n \nF\nUNCTIONAL\n \nU\nNIT\n \nOF\n\n\nN\nEURAL\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nA neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,\n\n\ncell body\n,\n \ndendrites\n \nand\n \naxon\n \n(Figure 18.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm\n\n\nwith typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called\n \nNissl’s granules\n.\n\n\nShort fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also\nRationalised 2023-24","232\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\ncontain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These\n\n\nfibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.\n \nThe\n\n\naxon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched.\n\n\nEach branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called\n\n\nsynaptic knob\n \nwhich possess synaptic vesicles\n\n\ncontaining chemicals called\n \nneurotransmitters\n. The\n\n\naxons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body\n\n\nto a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based\n\n\non the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are\n\n\ndivided into three types, i.e.,\n \nmultipolar\n \n(with one axon\n\n\nand two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),\n\n\nbipolar\n \n(with one axon and one dendrite, found in the\n\n\nretina of eye) and\n \nunipolar\n \n(cell body with one axon\n\n\nonly; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are\n\n\ntwo types of axons, namely,\n \nmyelinated\n \nand\n \nnon-\n\n\nmyelinated\n. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped\n\n\nwith\n \nSchwann cells,\n \nwhich form a myelin sheath\n\n\naround the axon. The gaps between two adjacent\n\n\nmyelin sheaths are called\n \nnodes of Ranvier\n.\n\n\nMyelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial\n\n\nnerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a\n\n\nSchwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath\n\n\naround the axon, and is commonly found in\n\n\nautonomous and the somatic neural systems.\n\n\n18.3.1\n \nGeneration and Conduction of\n\n\nNerve Impulse\n\n\nNeurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised\n\n\nstate.\n \nDo you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised?\n \nDifferent\n\n\ntypes of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion\n\n\nchannels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not\n\n\nconducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is\n\n\ncomparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K\n+\n) and nearly\n\n\nimpermeable to sodium ions (Na\n+\n). Similarly, the membrane is\n\n\nimpermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.\n\n\nConsequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration\n\n\nof K\n+\n \nand negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na\n+\n. In\n\n\ncontrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K\n+\n, a\n\n\nhigh concentration of Na\n+\n \nand thus form a concentration gradient. These\n\n\nionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active\n\n\ntransport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3\n\n\nNa\n+\n \noutwards for 2 K\n+\n \ninto the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the\n\n\naxonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface\n\n\nFigure 18.1\n \nStructure of a neuron\nRationalised 2023-24","N\nEURAL\n \nC\nONTROL\n \nAND\n \nC\nOORDINATION\n \n233\n\n\nbecomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical\n\n\npotential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the\n\n\nresting potential\n.\n\n\nYou might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation\n\n\nof nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is\n\n\napplied at a site (Figure 18.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,\n\n\nthe membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na\n+\n. This leads\n\n\nto a rapid influx of Na\n+\n \nfollowed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,\n\n\ni.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and\n\n\nthe inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane\n\n\nat the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential\n\n\ndifference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the\n\n\naction potential\n, which is in fact termed as a\n \nnerve impulse\n. At sites\n\n\nimmediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge\n\n\non the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a\n\n\nresult, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the\n\n\nouter surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 18.2) to complete\n\n\nthe circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and\n\n\nan action potential is generated at site B.\n \nThus, the\n \nimpulse\n \n(action\n\n\npotential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated\n\n\nalong the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.\n\n\nThe rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na\n+\n \nis extremely short-\n\n\nlived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K\n+\n. Within a fraction\n\n\nof a second, K\n+\n \ndiffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting\n\n\npotential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes\n\n\nonce more responsive to further stimulation.\n\n\n-\n \n-\n\n\n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n-\n \n-\n\n\n-\n \n-\n\n\n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n-\n \n-\n\n\nA\n\n\nNa\n\n\nB\n\n\nNa\n\n\nFigure 18.2\n \nDiagrammatic representation of impulse conduction through an axon\n\n\n(at points A and B)\nRationalised 2023-24","234\n \nB\nIOLOGY\n\n\n18.3.2 Transmission of Impulses\n\n\nA nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through\n\n\njunctions called synapses. A\n \nsynapse\n \nis formed by the membranes of a\n\n\npre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not\n\n\nbe separated by a gap called\n \nsynaptic cleft\n. There are two types of\n\n\nsynapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical\n\n\nsynapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very\n\n\nclose proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into\n\n\nthe other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across\n\n\nelectrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single\n\n\naxon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster\n\n\nthan that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our\n\n\nsystem.\n\n\nAt a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic\n\n\nneurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft\n\n\n(Figure 18.3).\n \nDo you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an\n\n\nimpulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic\n\n\nneuron\n? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the\n\n\ntransmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain\n\n\nvesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action\n\n\npotential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the\n\n\nsynaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma\n\n\nFigure 18.3\n \nDiagram showing axon terminal and synapse\nRationalised 2023-24","N\nEURAL\n \nC\nONTROL\n \nAND\n \nC\nOORDINATION\n \n235\n\n\nmembrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The\n\n\nreleased neurotransmitters bind to their specific\n \nreceptors\n, present on\n\n\nthe post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing\n\n\nthe entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic\n\n\nneuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or\n\n\ninhibitory.\n\n\n18.4\n \nC\nENTRAL\n \nN\nEURAL\n \nS\nYSTEM\n\n\nThe brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and\n\n\nacts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary\n\n\nmovements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs\n\n\n(e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,\n\n\ncircadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine\n\n\nglands and human behaviour. It is also the site for processing of vision,\n\n\nhearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.\n\n\nThe human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the\n\n\nbrain is covered by\n \ncranial meninges\n \nconsisting of an outer layer called\n\n\ndura mater\n, a very thin middle layer called\n \narachnoid\n \nand an inner layer\n\n\n(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called\n \npia mater\n.

Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep\n\n\ncleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed\n\n\nas the left and right\n \ncerebral hemispheres\n. The hemispheres are\n\n\nconnected by a tract of nerve fibres called\n \ncorpus callosum\n. The layer of\n\n\ncells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is\n\n\nthrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey\n\n\nmatter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are\n\n\nconcentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor\n\n\nareas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory\n\n\nnor motor in function. These regions called as the\n \nassociation areas\n \nare\n\n\nresponsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory\n\n\nand communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath,\n\n\nwhich constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an\n\n\nopaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter.\n\n\nThe cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major\n\n\ncoordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very\n\n\nimportant part of the brain called\n \nhypothalamus\n \nlies at the base of the\n\n\nthalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control\n\n\nbody temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several\n\n\ngroups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called\n\n\nhypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a\n\n\ngroup of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc.,\n\n\nform a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along\n\n\nwith the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour,\n\n\nexpression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and\n\n\nfear), and motivation.\n\n\n18.4.2 Midbrain\n\n\nThe midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of the\n\n\nforebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the\n \ncerebral aqueduct\n\n\npassess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists\n\n\nmainly of four round swellings (lobes) called\n \ncorpora quadrigemina\n.\n\n\n18.4.3 Hindbrain\n\n\nThe hindbrain comprises\n \npons\n,\n \ncerebellum\n \nand\n \nmedulla\n \n(also called\n\n\nthe medulla oblongata). Pons consists of fibre tracts that interconnect\n\n\ndifferent regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in\n\n\norder to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla\n\n\nof the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres\n\n\nwhich control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes and gastric secretions.\n\n\nThree major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons\n\n\nand medulla oblongata.

Neurons, the functional units of\n\n\nneural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of\n\n\nions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting\n\n\nneural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted\n\n\nalong the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and\n\n\nrepolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron\n\n\nand a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called\n\n\nsynaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical\n\n\nsynapses are called neurotransmitters.\n\n\nHuman neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS)\n\n\nand (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral\n\n\ncord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain\n\n\nand (iii) hindbrain.

The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditory\n\n\ninputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla.

It contains\n\n\nseveral groups of neurosecretory cells\n\n\ncalled nuclei which produce hormones.\n\n\nThese hormones regulate the synthesis\n\n\nand secretion of pituitary hormones.\n\n\nHowever, the hormones produced by\n\n\nhypothalamus are of two types, the\n\n\nreleasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and\n\n\nthe inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones).\n\n\nFor example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing\n\n\nhormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of\n\n\ngonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus\n\n\ninhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones\n\n\noriginating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are\n\n\nreleased from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary\n\n\ngland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of\n\n\nthe anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural\n\n\nregulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 19.2).\n\n\nFigure 19.1\n \nLocation of endocrine glands\n\n\nTestis\n\n\n(in male)\n\n\nOvary\n\n\n(in female)\n\n\nAdrenal\n\n\nPancreas\n\n\nThyroid and\n\n\nParathyroid\n\n\nThymus\n\n\nPineal\n\n\nPituitary\n\n\nHypothalamus\nRationalised 2023-24","241\n241\nC\nHEMICAL\n \nC\nOORDINATION\n \nAND\n \nI\nNTEGRATION\n\n\n19.2.2\n \nThe Pituitary Gland\n\n\nThe pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity\n\n\ncalled\n \nsella\n \ntursica\n \nand\n \nis\n \nattached\n \nto\n\n\nhypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 19.2). It is\n\n\ndivided anatomically into an\n \nadenohypophysis\n\n\nand a\n \nneurohypophysis\n. Adenohypophysis\n\n\nconsists of two portions, pars distalis and pars\n\n\nintermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary,\n\n\ncommonly called anterior pituitary, produces\n\n\ngrowth hormone\n \n(GH),\n \nprolactin\n \n(PRL),\n \nthyroid\n\n\nstimulating\n \nhormone\n \n(TSH),\n\n\nadrenocorticotrophic\n \nhormone\n \n(ACTH),\n\n\nluteinizing\n \nhormone\n \n(LH)\n \nand\n \nfollicle\n\n\nstimulating hormone\n \n(FSH). Pars intermedia\n\n\nsecretes only one hormone called\n \nmelanocyte\n\n\nstimulating\n \nhormone\n \n(MSH). However, in\n\n\nhumans, the pars intermedia is almost merged\n\n\nwith pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars\n\n\nnervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores\n\n\nand releases two hormones called\n \noxytocin\n \nand\n\n\nvasopressin,\n \nwhich are actually synthesised by\n\n\nthe hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.\n\n\nOver-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading\n\n\nto gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting\n\n\nin pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults\n\n\nespecially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of\n\n\nthe face) called\n \nAcromegaly\n, which may lead to serious complications,\n\n\nand premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in\n\n\nthe early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes\n\n\nin external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of\n\n\nthe mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the\n\n\nsynthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH\n\n\nstimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called\n\n\nglucocorticoids\n \nfrom the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal\n\n\nactivity and hence are called\n \ngonadotrophins\n. In males, LH stimulates\n\n\nthe synthesis and secretion of hormones called\n \nandrogens\n \nfrom testis.\n\n\nIn males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH\n\n\ninduces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains\n\n\nthe corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles\n\n\nafter ovulation.

MSH acts on the melanocytes\n\n\n(melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation\n\n\nof the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of\n\n\nour body and stimulates their contraction. In females,\n\n\nit stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the\n\n\ntime of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary\n\n\ngland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and\n\n\nstimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the\n\n\ndistal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water\n\n\nthrough urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as\n \nanti-\n\n\ndiuretic hormone\n \n(ADH).\n\n\nAn impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH\n\n\nresults in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve\n\n\nwater leading to water loss and dehydration. This\n\n\ncondition is known as\n \nDiabetes Insipidus\n.\n\n\n19.2.3\n \nThe Pineal Gland\n\n\nThe pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of\n\n\nforebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called\n \nmelatonin\n.\n\n\nMelatonin plays a very important role in the regulation\n\n\nof a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For\n\n\nexample, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms\n\n\nof sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition,\n\n\nmelatonin also influences metabolism, pigmentation,\n\n\nthe menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability.\n\n\n19.2.4\n \nThyroid Gland\n\n\nThe thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are\n\n\nlocated on either side of the trachea (Figure 19.3 a). Both\n\n\nthe lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective\n\n\ntissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of\n\n\nfollicles\n \nand\n \nstromal tissues\n. Each thyroid follicle is\n\n\ncomposed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These\n\n\nfollicular\n \ncells\n \nsynthesise\n \ntwo\n \nhormones,\n\n\ntetraiodothyronine\n \nor\n \nthyroxine\n \n(T\n4\n)\n \nand\n\n\ntriiodothyronine\n \n(T\n3\n). Iodine is essential for the normal\n\n\nrate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of\n\n\niodine in our diet results in\n \nhypothyroidism\n \nand\n\n\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called\n\n\ngoitre\n. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes\n\n\ndefective development and maturation of the growing\n\n\nbaby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental\n\n\nFigure 19.3\n \nDiagrammatic view of the\n\n\nposition\n \nof\n \nThyroid\n \nand\n\n\nParathyroid\n\n\n(a) Ventral side\n\n\n(b) Dorsal side\nRationalised 2023-24","243\n243\nC\nHEMICAL\n \nC\nOORDINATION\n \nAND\n \nI\nNTEGRATION\n\n\nretardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In\n\n\nadult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become\n\n\nirregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of\n\n\nnodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the\n\n\nthyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition\n\n\ncalled\n \nhyperthyroidism\n \nwhich adversely affects the body physiology.\n\n\nExopthalmic goitre\n \nis a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by\n\n\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased\n\n\nbasal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called\n \nGraves’ disease.\n\n\nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal\n\n\nmetabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell\n\n\nformation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins\n\n\nand fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by\n\n\nthyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called\n\n\nthyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.\n\n\n19.2.5\n \nParathyroid Gland\n\n\nIn humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the\n\n\nthyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure\n\n\n19.3 b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called\n\n\nparathyroid hormone\n \n(PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the\n\n\ncirculating levels of calcium ions.\n\n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca\n2+\n \nlevels in the blood. PTH\n\n\nacts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/\n\n\ndemineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca\n2+\n \nby the renal\n\n\ntubules and increases Ca\n2+\n \nabsorption from the digested food. It is, thus,\n\n\nclear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood\n\n\nCa\n2+\n \nlevels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance\n\n\nin the body.\n\n\n19.2.6\n \nThymus\n\n\nThe thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind\n\n\nsternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in\n\n\nthe development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide\n\n\nhormones called\n \nthymosins\n. Thymosins play a major role in the\n\n\ndifferentiation of\n \nT-lymphocytes\n, which provide\n \ncell-mediated\n\n\nimmunity\n.\n \nIn addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies\n\n\nto provide\n \nhumoral immunity\n. Thymus is degenerated in old individuals\n\n\nresulting in a decreased production of thymosins. As a result, the immune\n\n\nresponses of old persons become weak.\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOLOGY\n244\n\n\nThe adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called\n \nadrenaline\n \nor\n\n\nepinephrine\n \nand\n \nnoradrenaline\n \nor\n \nnorepinephrine\n. These are\n\n\ncommonly called as\n \ncatecholamines\n. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are\n\n\nrapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergency\n\n\nsituations and are called\n \nemergency hormones\n \nor\n \nhormones of Fight\n\n\nor Flight\n. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation,\n\n\npiloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase\n\n\nthe heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.\n\n\nCatecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in\n\n\n19.2.7\n \nAdrenal Gland\n\n\nOur body has one pair of adrenal glands, one at the anterior part of each\n\n\nkidney (Figure 19.4 a).

In addition, they also\n\n\nstimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins.\n\n\nThe adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called\n \nzona\n\n\nreticularis\n \n(inner layer),\n \nzona fasciculata\n \n(middle layer) and\n \nzona\n\n\nglomerulosa\n \n(outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones,\n\n\ncommonly called as\n \ncorticoids\n. The corticoids, which are involved in\n\n\ncarbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol\n\n\nis the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water\n\n\nand electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is\n\n\nthe main mineralocorticoid in our body.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis;\n\n\nand inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also\n\n\ninvolved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney\n\n\nfunctions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti-\n\n\ninflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol\n\n\nstimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal\n\n\ntubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na\n+\n \nand water and excretion\n\n\nof K\n+\n \nand phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of\n\n\nelectrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.\n\n\nSmall amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal\n\n\ncortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial\n\n\nhair during puberty.\n\n\n19.2.8\n \nPancreas\n\n\nPancreas is a composite gland (Figure 19.1) which acts as both exocrine\n\n\nand endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of\n\n\nLangerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a\n\n\nnormal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic\n\n\ntissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called\n\n\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\n-cells\n \nand\n \nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\n-cells\n. The\n \nα\n-cells secrete a hormone called\n \nglucagon\n, while\n\n\nthe\n \nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\n-cells secrete\n \ninsulin\n.\n\n\nGlucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in\n\n\nmaintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on\n\n\nthe liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an\n\n\nincreased blood sugar (\nhyperglycemia\n). In addition, this hormone\n\n\nstimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to\n\n\nhyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and\n\n\nutilisation. Thus, glucagon is a\n \nhyperglycemic hormone\n.\n\n\nInsulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the\n\n\nregulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes\n\n\nand adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose\nRationalised 2023-24","B\nIOLOGY\n246\n\n\nuptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucose\n\n\nfrom blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased blood\n\n\nglucose levels (\nhypoglycemia\n). Insulin also stimulates conversion of\n\n\nglucose to glycogen (\nglycogenesis\n) in the target cells. The glucose\n\n\nhomeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin and\n\n\nglucagons.\n\n\nProlonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called\n \ndiabetes\n\n\nmellitus\n \nwhich is associated with loss of glucose through urine and\n\n\nformation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic\n\n\npatients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.\n\n\n19.2.9\n \nTestis\n\n\nA pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of male\n\n\nindividuals (Figure 19.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primary\n\n\nsex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed of\n\n\nseminiferous tubules\n \nand\n \nstromal or interstitial tissue.\n \nThe\n \nLeydig\n\n\ncells\n \nor\n \ninterstitial cells\n, which are present in the intertubular\n\n\nspaces produce a group of hormones called\n \nandrogens\n \nmainly\n\n\ntestosterone.\n\n\nAndrogens regulate the development, maturation and functions of\n\n\nthe male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal\n\n\nvesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular\n\n\ngrowth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of\n\n\nvoice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of\n\n\nspermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central\n\n\nneural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These\n\n\nhormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate\n\n\nmetabolism.\n\n\n19.2.10\n \nOvary\n\n\nFemales have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 19.1). Ovary\n\n\nis the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each\n\n\nmenstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid\n\n\nhormones called\n \nestrogen\n \nand\n \nprogesterone\n. Ovary is composed of\n\n\novarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and\n\n\nsecreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the\n\n\nruptured follicle is converted to a structure called\n \ncorpus luteum\n, which\n\n\nsecretes mainly\n \nprogesterone\n.\n\n\nEstrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth\n\n\nand activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing\nRationalised 2023-24","247\n247\nC\nHEMICAL\n \nC\nOORDINATION\n \nAND\n \nI\nNTEGRATION\n\n\novarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high\n\n\npitch of voice, etc.), mammary gland development.

Progesterone also acts on the\n\n\nmammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like\n\n\nstructures which store milk) and milk secretion.\n\n\n19.3\n \nH\nORMONES\n \nOF\n \nH\nEART\n, K\nIDNEY\n \nAND\n \nG\nASTROINTESTINAL\n \nT\nRACT\n\n\nNow you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However,\n\n\nas mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which\n\n\nare not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes\n\n\na very important peptide hormone called\n \natrial natriuretic factor\n \n(ANF),\n\n\nwhich decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF\n\n\nis secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the\n\n\nblood pressure.\n\n\nThe juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called\n\n\nerythropoietin\n \nwhich stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).\n\n\nEndocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract\n\n\nsecrete four major peptide hormones, namely\n \ngastrin\n,\n \nsecretin\n,\n\n\ncholecystokinin\n \n(CCK) and\n \ngastric inhibitory peptide\n \n(GIP). Gastrin\n\n\nacts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric\n\n\nacid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and\n\n\nstimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both\n\n\npancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic\n\n\nenzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and\n\n\nmotility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called\n\n\ngrowth factors.\n \nThese factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues\n\n\nand their repairing/regeneration.\n\n\n19.4\n \nM\nECHANISM\n \nOF\n \nH\nORMONE\n \nA\nCTION\n\n\nHormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specific\n\n\nproteins called\n \nhormone receptors\n \nlocated in the target tissues only.\n\n\nHormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are\n\n\ncalled membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the\n\n\ntarget cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors\n\n\n(present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to the\n\n\nformation of a\n \nhormone-receptor complex\n \n(Figure 19.5 a, b).

Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g., steroid\n\n\nhormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or\n\n\nchromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex\n\n\nwith the genome.

These hormones\n\n\nregulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands\n\n\nor certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary\n\n\nand pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis\n\n\nand ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,\n\n\nkidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into\n\n\nthree major parts, which are called as\n \npars distalis, pars intermedia and pars\n\n\nnervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones.

Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which\n\n\nplays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our\n\n\nbody (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The\n\n\nthyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal\n\n\nmetabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system,\n\n\nerythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle.\n\n\nAnother thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood\n\n\nby decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which\n\n\nincreases the blood Ca\n2+\n \nlevels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The\n\n\nthymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of\n\n\nT-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins\n\n\nalso increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The\n\n\nadrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer\n\n\nadrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\n\nThese hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart\n\n\nbeat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis,\n\n\nproteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis,\n\n\ncardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit\n\n\ninflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids\n\n\nregulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes\n\n\nglucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis\n\n\nresulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and\n\n\nutilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency\n\n\nand/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nThe testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation\n\n\nand functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary\n\n\nsex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and\n\n\nerythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates\n\n\ngrowth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex\n\n\ncharacters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as\n\n\nwell as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart\n\n\nproduces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney\n\n\nproduces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract\n\n\nsecretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide.

The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically\n\n\nto form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the\n \n2-\n\n\nnucleate\n \nembryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions\n\n\nresult in the formation of the\n \n4-nucleate\n \nand later the\n \n8-nucleate\n \nstages\n\n\nof the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are\n\n\nstrictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately\n\n\nby cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down\n\n\nleading to the organisation of the typical\n \nfemale\n \ngametophyte\n\n\nor\n \nembryo sac\n. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac\n\n\n(Figure 1.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and\n\n\norganised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are\n\n\nsituated below the egg apparatus in the large\n \ncentral cell.\n\n\nThere is a\n \ncharacteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo\n\n\nsac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute\n\n\nthe\n \negg apparatus\n. The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two\n \nsynergids\n\n\nand one\n \negg cell\n. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the\n\n\nmicropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in\n\n\nguiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal\n\n\nend and are called the\n \nantipodals\n. The large central cell, as mentioned\n\n\nearlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at\n\n\nmaturity, though\n \n8-nucleate\n \nis\n \n7-celled\n.\n\n\n1.2.3 Pollination\n\n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes\n\n\nin flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,\n\n\nrespectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be\n\n\nbrought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?\n\n\nPollination\n \nis the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer\n\n\nof pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is\n\n\ntermed\n \npollination\n. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array\n\n\nof adaptations to achieve pollination\n.\n \nThey make use of\n \nexternal\n\n\nagents to achieve pollination.\n \nCan you list the possible external\n\n\nagents?\n\n\nKinds of Pollination :\n \nDepending on the source of pollen, pollination\n\n\ncan be divided into three types.\n\n\n(i)\n \nAutogamy\nAutogamy\nAutogamy\nAutogamy\nAutogamy\n \n:\n \nIn this type, pollination is achieved within the same\n\n\nflower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the\n\n\nsame flower (Figure 1.9a). In a normal flower which opens and\n\n\nexposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather\n\n\nrare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release\n\n\nand stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should\nRationalised 2023-24","12\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nlie close to each other so that self-pollination\n\n\ncan\n \noccur.\n \nSome\n \nplants\n \nsuch\n \nas\n \nViola\n\n\n(common pansy)\n, Oxalis,\n \nand\n \nCommelina\n\n\nproduce\n \ntwo\n \ntypes\n \nof\n \nflowers\n \n–\n\n\nchasmogamous\n \nflowers which are similar to\n\n\nflowers of other species with exposed anthers\n\n\nand stigma, and\n \ncleistogamous\n \nflowers\n \nwhich\n\n\ndo not open at all (Figure 1.9c). In such flowers,\n\n\nthe anthers and stigma lie close to each other.\n\n\nWhen anthers dehisce in the flower buds,\n\n\npollen grains come in contact with the stigma\n\n\nto effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous\n\n\nflowers are invariably autogamous as there is\n\n\nno chance of cross-pollen landing on the\n\n\nstigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce\n\n\nassured seed-set even in the absence of\n\n\npollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is\n\n\nadvantageous or disadvantageous to the\n\n\nplant? Why?\n\n\n(ii)\n \nGeitonogamy\nGeitonogamy\nGeitonogamy\nGeitonogamy\nGeitonogamy\n \n–\n \nTransfer of pollen grains from\n\n\nthe anther to the stigma of another flower of\n\n\nthe same plant. Although geitonogamy is\n\n\nfunctionally cross-pollination involving a\n\n\npollinating agent, genetically it is similar to\n\n\nautogamy since the pollen grains come from\n\n\nthe same plant.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nXenogamy\nXenogamy\nXenogamy\nXenogamy\nXenogamy\n \n–\n \nTransfer of pollen grains from\n\n\nanther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure\n\n\n1.9b). This is the only type of pollination which\n\n\nduring pollination brings genetically different\n\n\ntypes of pollen grains to the stigma.\n\n\nAgents of Pollination :\n \nPlants use two abiotic (wind\n\n\nand water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve\n\n\npollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for\n\n\npollination. Only a small proportion of plants use\n\n\nabiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with\n\n\nthe stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water\n\n\npollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and\n\n\nassociated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce\n\n\nenormous amount of pollen when compared to the\n\n\nnumber of ovules available for pollination.\n\n\nFigure 1.9\n \n(a) Self-pollinated flowers;\n\n\n(b) Cross pollinated flowers;\n\n\n(c) Cleistogamous flowers\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n(b)\nRationalised 2023-24","13\n\n\nH\nUMAN\n \nR\nEPRODUCTION\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n\nPollination by wind is more common\n\n\namongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination\n\n\nalso requires that the pollen grains are light\n\n\nand\n \nnon-sticky\n \nso\n \nthat\n \nthey\n \ncan\n \nbe\n\n\ntransported in wind currents. They often\n\n\npossess well-exposed stamens (so that the\n\n\npollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,\n\n\nFigure 1.10) and large often-feathery stigma\n\n\nto easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-\n\n\npollinated flowers often have a single ovule in\n\n\neach ovary and numerous flowers packed into\n\n\nan inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn\n\n\ncob – the tassels you see are nothing but the\n\n\nstigma and style which wave in the wind to\n\n\ntrap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite\n\n\ncommon in grasses.\n\n\nPollination by water is quite rare in\n\n\nflowering plants and is limited to about 30\n\n\ngenera, mostly monocotyledons. As against\n\n\nthis, you would recall that water is a regular\n\n\nmode of transport for the male gametes among\n\n\nthe lower plant groups such as algae,\n\n\nbryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,\n\n\nparticularly\n \nfor\n \nsome\n \nbryophytes\n \nand\n\n\npteridophytes, that their distribution is limited\n\n\nbecause of the need for water for the transport\n\n\nof male gametes and fertilisation. Some\n\n\nexamples of water pollinated plants are\n \nVallisneria\n \nand\n \nHydrilla\n \nwhich\n\n\ngrow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as\n \nZostera\n. Not\n\n\nall aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants\n\n\nsuch as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level\n\n\nof water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land\n\n\nplants. In\n \nVallisneria,\n \nthe female flower reach the surface of water by the\n\n\nlong stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the\n\n\nsurface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure\n\n\n1.11a); some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.\n\n\nIn another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female\n\n\nflowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released\n\n\ninside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like\n\n\nand they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the\n\n\nstigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,\n\n\npollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.\n\n\nBoth wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do\n\n\nnot produce nectar.\n \nWhat would be the reason for this?\n\n\nFigure 1.10\n \nA wind-pollinated plant showing\n\n\ncompact inflorecence and well-\n\n\nexposed stamens\nRationalised 2023-24","14\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nMajority of flowering plants use\n\n\na range of animals as pollinating\n\n\nagents. Bees, butterflies, flies,\n\n\nbeetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds\n\n\n(sunbirds and humming birds) and\n\n\nbats are the common pollinating\n\n\nagents. (Figure 1.11b). Among the\n\n\nanimals, insects, particularly bees\n\n\nare the dominant biotic pollinating\n\n\nagents.\n \nEven larger animals such\n\n\nas some primates (lemurs), arboreal\n\n\n(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even\n\n\nreptiles (gecko lizard and garden\n\n\nlizard) have also been reported as\n\n\npollinators in some species.\n\n\nOften\n \nflowers\n \nof\n \nanimal-\n\n\npollinated plants are specifically\n\n\nadapted for a particular species of\n\n\nanimal.\n\n\nMajority of insect-pollinated\n\n\nflowers are large, colourful, fragrant\n\n\nand rich in nectar. When the flowers\n\n\nare small, a number of flowers are\n\n\nclustered into an inflorescence to\n\n\nmake them conspicuous. Animals\n\n\nare attracted to flowers by colour\n\n\nand/or fragrance. The flowers\n\n\npollinated by flies and beetles\n\n\nsecrete foul odours to attract these\n\n\nanimals. To sustain animal visits,\n\n\nthe flowers have to provide rewards\n\n\nto the animals. Nectar and pollen\n\n\ngrains are the usual floral rewards.\n\n\nFor harvesting the reward(s) from\n\n\nthe flower the animal visitor comes\n\n\nin contact with the anthers and the\n\n\nstigma. The body of the animal gets\n\n\na coating of pollen grains, which are\n\n\ngenerally sticky in animal pollinated flowers. When the animal carrying\n\n\npollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about\n\n\npollination.\n\n\nIn some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;\n\n\nan example is that of the tallest flower of\n \nAmorphophallus\n \n(the flower\n\n\nitself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a\n\n\nspecies of moth and the plant\n \nYucca\n \nwhere both species – moth and the\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 1.11\n \n(a) Pollination by water in\n \nVallisneria\n;\n\n\n(b) Insect pollination\nRationalised 2023-24","15\n\n\nH\nUMAN\n \nR\nEPRODUCTION\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n\nplant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth\n\n\ndeposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets\n\n\npollinated by the moth.\n \nThe larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as\n\n\nthe seeds start developing.\n\n\nWhy don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any\n\n\nothers available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,\n\n\nOnion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to\n\n\nfind out which animals visit them and whether they could be\n\n\npollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days\n\n\nand at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there\n\n\nis any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that\n\n\nvisits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the\n\n\nanthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination.\n\n\nMany insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about\n\n\npollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.\n\n\nYou may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely\n\n\nenjoy your efforts!\n\n\nOutbreeding Devices :\n \nMajority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite\n\n\nflowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of\n\n\nthe same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.\n\n\nFlowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-\n\n\npollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen\n\n\nrelease and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is\n\n\nreleased before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive\n\n\nmuch before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and\n\n\nstigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in\n\n\ncontact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent\n\n\nautogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.\n\n\nThis is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower\n\n\nor other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting\n\n\npollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to\n\n\nprevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male\n\n\nand female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize\n\n\n(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species\n\n\nsuch as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,\n\n\nthat is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents\n\n\nboth autogamy and geitonogamy.\n\n\nPollen-pistil Interaction :\n \nPollination does not guarantee the transfer\n\n\nof the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the\n\n\nstigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from\n\n\nthe same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The\n\n\npistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type\n\n\n(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,\n\n\nthe pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that\nRationalised 2023-24","16\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nleads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the\n\n\npollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube\n\n\ngrowth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed\n\n\nby its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue\n\n\nbetween pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical\n\n\ncomponents of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in\n\n\nrecent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen\n\n\nand pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,\n\n\nfollowed by acceptance or rejection.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain\n\n\ngerminates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the\n\n\ngerm pores (Figure 1.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the\n\n\nFigure 1.12\n \n(a) Pollen grains germinating on the stigma; (b) Pollen tubes growing through the\n\n\nstyle; (c) L.S. of pistil showing path of pollen tube growth; (d) enlarged view of an\n\n\negg apparatus showing entry of pollen tube into a synergid; (e) Discharge of male\n\n\ngametes into a synergid and the movements of the sperms, one into the egg and\n\n\nthe other into the central cell\n\n\n(e)\n(d)\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\n \n(c)\nRationalised 2023-24","17\n\n\nH\nUMAN\n \nR\nEPRODUCTION\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n\npollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and\n\n\nstyle and reaches the ovary (Figure 1.12b, c). You would recall that in\n\n\nsome plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative\n\n\ncell and a generative cell). In such plants, the generative cell divides and\n\n\nforms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.\n\n\nIn plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes\n\n\ncarry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching\n\n\nthe ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of\n\n\nthe synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 1.12d, e). Many recent\n\n\nstudies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part\n\n\nof the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.\n \nAll these events–from\n\n\npollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are\n\n\ntogether referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,\n\n\npollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition\n\n\nfollowed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained\n\n\nin this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil\n\n\ninteraction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.\n\n\nYou can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from\n\n\nflowers such as pea, chickpea,\n \nCrotalaria\n, balsam and\n \nVinca\n \non a glass slide\n\n\ncontaining a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30\n\n\nminutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You\n\n\nare likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.\n\n\nA breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera\n\n\nto combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’\n\n\nvarieties.\n \nArtificial hybridisation\n \nis one of the major approaches of crop\n\n\nimprovement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important\n\n\nto make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination\n\n\nand the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen).\n\n\nThis is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.\n\n\nIf the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from\n\n\nthe flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is\n\n\nnecessary. This step is referred to as\n \nemasculation\n. Emasculated flowers\n\n\nhave to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter\n\n\npaper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This\n\n\nprocess is called\n \nbagging\n. When the stigma of bagged flower attains\n\n\nreceptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent\n\n\nare dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits\n\n\nallowed to develop.\n\n\nIf the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for\n\n\nemasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.\n\n\nWhen the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the\n\n\ndesired pollen and the flower rebagged.\nRationalised 2023-24","18\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\n1.4 P\nOST\n-\n \nFERTILISATION\n \n: S\nTRUCTURES\n \nAND\n \nE\nVENTS\n\n\nFollowing double fertilisation, events of\n \nendosperm and embryo\n\n\ndevelopment, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are\n\n\ncollectively termed\n \npost-fertilisation\n \nevents.\n\n\n1.4.1 Endosperm\n\n\nEndosperm development precedes embryo development.\n \nWhy?\n \nThe\n\n\nprimary endosperm cell divides repeatedly and forms a triploid\n\n\nFigure 1.13\n \n(a) Fertilised embryo sac showing zygote and Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN);\n\n\n(b) Stages in embryo development in a dicot [shown in reduced size as compared to (a)]\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\n\n\n1.3 D\nOUBLE\n \nF\nERTILISATION\n\n\nAfter entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male\n\n\ngametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid.

This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the\n \nzygote.\n \nThe\n\n\nother male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central\n\n\ncell and fuses with them to produce a triploid\n \nprimary endosperm nucleus\n\n\n(PEN) (Figure 1.13a).\n \nAs this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it\n\n\nis termed\n \ntriple fusion.\n \nSince two types of fusions, syngamy and triple\n\n\nfusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed\n \ndouble\n\n\nfertilisation\n, an event unique to flowering plants.

A\n\n\nseed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.\n\n\nThe cotyledons (Figure 1.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,\n\n\ngenerally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes).\n\n\nMature seeds may be\n \nnon-albuminous\n \nor\n \nex-albuminous\n. Non-\n\n\nalbuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely\n\n\nconsumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut).\n\n\nAlbuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used\n\n\nup during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).\n\n\nOccasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of\n\n\nnucellus are also persistent.\n \nThis residual, persistent nucellus is the\n\n\nperisperm.\n\n\nInteguments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats\n\n\n(Figure 1.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat.\n\n\nThis facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.\n\n\nAs the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become\n\n\nrelatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic\n\n\nactivity of the embryo slows down.\n \nThe embryo may\n \nenter a state of\n\n\ninactivity called\n \ndormancy,\n \nor if favourable conditions are available\n\n\n(adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature),\n \nthey germinate.\n\n\nAs ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the\n\n\ntransformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds\n\n\nsimultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called\n\n\npericarp\n. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or\n\n\nmay be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved\n\n\nmechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classification of fruits and\n\n\ntheir dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class.\n \nIs\n\n\nthere any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the\n\n\nnumber of seeds present in a fruit?\n\n\nIn most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other\n\n\nfloral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,\n\n\nstrawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation.\n\n\nSuch fruits are called\n \nfalse fruits\n \n(Figure 1.15b).\n \nMost fruits however\n\n\ndevelop only from the ovary and are called\n \ntrue fruits\n. Although in most\n\n\nof the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species\nRationalised 2023-24","21\n\n\nH\nUMAN\n \nR\nEPRODUCTION\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n\nin which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called\n\n\nparthenocarpic\n \nfruits.\n \nBanana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can\n\n\nbe induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits\n\n\nare seedless.\n\n\nSeeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since\n\n\nreproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are\n\n\nindependent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have\n\n\nbetter adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species\n\n\nFigure 1.15\n \n(a) Structure of some seeds.

As they have sufficient food reserves, young\n\n\nseedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their\n\n\nown. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being\n\n\nproducts of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations\n\n\nleading to variations.\n\n\nSeed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of\n\n\nmature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food\n\n\nthroughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you\n\n\nimagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds\n\n\nwhich germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?\n\n\nHow long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This\n\n\nperiod again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within\n\n\na few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years.\n\n\nSome seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several\n\n\nrecords of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine,\n \nLupinus\n\n\narcticus\n \nexcavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered\n\n\nafter an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of\n\n\n2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm,\n \nPhoenix dactylifera\n\n\ndiscovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace\n\n\nnear the Dead Sea.\n\n\nAfter completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering\n\n\nplants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous\n\n\nreproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking the following\n\n\nquestions:\n \nHow many eggs are present in an embryo sac?

And so on...\n\n\nCan you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large\n\n\nnumber of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit\n\n\ncontain thousands of tiny seeds.

In the flower,\n\n\nandroecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive\n\n\norgans and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female\n\n\nreproductive organs.\n\n\nA typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate.\n \nPollen\n\n\ngrains develop inside the microsporangia.\n \nFour wall layers, the\n\n\nepidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the\n\n\nmicrosporangium. Cells of the\n \nsporogenous tissue lying in the centre of\n\n\nthe microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form\n\n\ntetrads of microspores.\n \nIndividual microspores mature into pollen grains.\n\n\nPollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation.\n \nThe\n\n\npollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.\n\n\nThe exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores.\n \nPollen grains\n\n\nmay have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a\n\n\nvegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.\n\n\nThe pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary.\n \nOvules\n\n\nare present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective\n\n\nintegument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is\n\n\nthe nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the\n\n\narchesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of\n\n\nthe megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The\n\n\nmature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate.\n \nAt the micropylar end is\n\n\nvarieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start\n\n\ndividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In\n\n\nsuch species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more\n\n\nthan one embryo in a seed is referred to as\n \npolyembryony\n.\n \nTake out\n\n\nsome seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of\n\n\ndifferent sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos\n\n\nin each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos?\n\n\nCan they be called clones?\n\n\nHybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being\n\n\nextensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased\n\n\nproductivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have\n\n\nto be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,\n\n\nthe plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid\n\n\ncharacters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of\n\n\nhybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are\n\n\nmade into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid\n\n\nprogeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise\n\n\nnew crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every\n\n\nyear. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,\n\n\nactive research is going on in many laboratories around the world to\n\n\nunderstand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes\n\n\ninto hybrid varieties.\nRationalised 2023-24","24\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nEXERCISES\n\n\n1.\n \nName the parts of an angiosperm flower in which development of male\n\n\nand female gametophyte take place.\n\n\n2.\n \nDifferentiate between microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis.

The secondary\n\n\nspermatocytes undergo the second meiotic\n\n\ndivision to produce four equal, haploid\n\n\nspermatids\n \n(Figure 2.5).\n \nWhat would be the\n\n\nnumber of chromosome in the spermatids?\n\n\nThe\n \nspermatids\n \nare\n \ntransformed\n \ninto\n\n\nspermatozoa\n \n(\nsperms\n)\n \nby the process\n\n\ncalled\n \ns p e r m i o g e n e s i s\n.\n \nAfter\n\n\nspermiogenesis,\n \nsperm\n \nheads\n \nbecome\n\n\nembedded in the\n \nSertoli cells\n, and are finally\n\n\nreleased from the seminiferous tubules by\n\n\nthe process called\n \nspermiation\n.\n\n\nSpermatogenesis starts at the age of\n\n\npuberty due to significant increase in the\n\n\nsecretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone\n\n\n(GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased\n\n\nlevels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates\n\n\nsecretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle\n\n\nstimulating hormone (FSH). LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates\n\n\nsynthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the\n\n\nprocess of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates\n\n\nFigure 2.5\n \nDiagrammatic sectional view of a\n\n\nseminiferous tubule (enlarged)\nRationalised 2023-24","32\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nsecretion of some factors which help in the\n\n\nprocess of spermiogenesis.\n\n\nLet us examine the structure of a sperm. It\n\n\nis a microscopic structure composed of a\n \nhead\n,\n\n\nneck,\n \na\n \nmiddle piece\n \nand a\n \ntail\n \n(Figure 2.6).\n\n\nA plasma membrane envelops the whole body\n\n\nof sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated\n\n\nhaploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which\n\n\nis covered by a cap-like structure,\n \nacrosome\n.\n\n\nThe acrosome is filled with enzymes that help\n\n\nfertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece\n\n\npossesses numerous mitochondria, which\n\n\nproduce energy for the movement of\n \ntail that\n\n\nfacilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.\n\n\nThe human male ejaculates about 200 to 300\n\n\nmillion sperms during a coitus of which, for\n\n\nnormal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms\n\n\nmust have normal shape and size and at least\n\n\n40 per cent of them must show vigorous\n\n\nmotility.\n\n\nSperms released from the seminiferous\n\n\ntubules, are transported by the accessory\n\n\nducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and\n\n\nprostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal\n\n\nplasma along with the sperms constitute the\n \nsemen\n. The functions of\n\n\nmale sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular\n\n\nhormones (androgens).\n\n\nThe process of formation of a mature female gamete is called\n \noogenesis\n\n\nwhich is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated\n\n\nduring the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete\n\n\nmother cells (\noogonia\n) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia\n\n\nare formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into\n\n\nprophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage,\n\n\ncalled\n \nprimary oocytes\n. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a\n\n\nlayer of granulosa cells and is called the\n \nprimary follicle\n \n(Figure 2.7). A\n\n\nlarge number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to\n\n\npuberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are\n\n\nleft in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of\n\n\ngranulosa cells and a new theca and are called\n \nsecondary follicles\n.\n\n\nThe secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle\n \nwhich is\n\n\ncharacterised by a fluid filled cavity called\n \nantrum\n. The theca layer is\n\n\norganised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is\n\n\nimportant to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary\n\n\noocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic\n\n\ndivision. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large\n\n\nhaploid\n \nsecondary oocyte\n \nand a tiny first polar body (Figure 2.8b). The\n\n\nFigure 2.6\n \nStructure of a sperm\nRationalised 2023-24","33\n\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n\nsecondary oocyte retains bulk of the\n\n\nnutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary\n\n\noocyte.\n \nCan you think of any advantage\n\n\nfor this?\n \nDoes the first polar body born\n\n\nout of first meiotic division divide further\n\n\nor degenerate?\n \nAt present we are not\n\n\nvery certain about this. The tertiary\n\n\nfollicle further changes into the mature\n\n\nfollicle or\n \nGraafian follicle\n \n(Figure 2.7).\n\n\nThe secondary oocyte forms a new\n\n\nmembrane\n \ncalled\n \nzona\n \npellucida\n\n\nsurrounding it. The Graafian follicle now\n\n\nruptures to release the secondary oocyte\n\n\n(ovum)\n \nfrom\n \nthe\n \novary\n \nby\n \nthe\n\n\nprocess called\n \novulation\n.\n \nCan you\n\n\nidentify major differences between\n\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis?\n \nA diagrammatic representation of\n\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below (Figure 2.8).\n\n\nFigure 2.7\n \nDiagrammatic Section view of ovary\n\n\nFigure 2.8\n \nSchematic representation of (a) Spermatogenesis; (b) Oogenesis\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\n\n\n2.4 M\nENSTRUAL\n \nC\nYCLE\n\n\nThe reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and\n\n\nhuman beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins\n\n\nat puberty and is called\n \nmenarche\n. In human females, menstruation\n\n\nis repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of\n\n\nevents starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the\n\n\nmenstrual cycle\n. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle\nRationalised 2023-24","34\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 2.9\n \nDiagrammatic presentation of various events during a menstrual cycle\n\n\nof each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are\n\n\nshown in Figure 2.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when\n\n\nmenstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow\n\n\nresults due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its\n\n\nblood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.\n\n\nMenstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of\n\n\nmenstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be\n\n\ncaused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.\n\n\nThe menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During\n\n\nthis phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a\n\n\nfully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium\n\n\nof uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the\n\n\novary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of\n\n\npituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 2.9). The secretion of\nRationalised 2023-24","35\n\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n\ngonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular\n\n\nphase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of\n\n\nestrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level\n\n\nin the middle of cycle (about 14\nth\n \nday). Rapid secretion of LH leading to\n\n\nits maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture\n\n\nof Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (\novulation\n). The\n\n\novulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which\n\n\nthe remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the\n \ncorpus\n\n\nluteum\n \n(Figure 2.9). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of\n\n\nprogesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.\n\n\nSuch an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised\n\n\novum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of\n\n\nthe menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation. In the absence\n\n\nof fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration\n\n\nof the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle. In\n\n\nhuman beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is\n\n\ntermed as\n \nmenopause\n. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal\n\n\nreproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause.\n\n\n2.5 F\nERTILISATION\n \nAND\n \nI\nMPLANTATION\n\n\nDuring copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina\n\n\n(insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,\n\n\nenter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the\n\n\nfallopian tube (Figure 2.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also\n\n\ntransported to the ampullary region\n\n\nwhere\n \nfertilisation\n \ntakes\n \nplace.\n\n\nFertilisation can only occur if the\n\n\novum and sperms are transported\n\n\nsimultaneously to the ampullary\n\n\nregion. This is the reason why not all\n\n\ncopulations lead to fertilisation and\n\n\npregnancy.\n\n\nThe process of fusion of a sperm\n\n\nwith an ovum is called\n \nfertilisation\n.\n\n\nDuring fertilisation, a sperm comes in\n\n\ncontact with the\n \nzona pellucida\n \nlayer\n\n\nof the ovum (Figure 2.10) and induces\n\n\nchanges in the membrane that block\n\n\nthe entry of additional sperms. Thus,\n\n\nit ensures that only one sperm can\n\n\nfertilise an ovum. The secretions of the\n\n\nacrosome help the sperm enter into the\n\n\ncytoplasm of the ovum through the\n\n\nzona\n \npellucida\n \nand\n \nthe\n \nplasma\n \nFigure 2.10\n \nOvum surrounded by few sperms\n\n\n35\n\n\nMaintenance of\n\n\nhygiene and sanitation\n\n\nduring menstruation is\n\n\nvery important. Take\n\n\nbath and clean yourself\n\n\nregulary. Use sanitary\n\n\nnapkins or clean\n\n\nhomemade pads.\n\n\nChange sanitary\n\n\nnapkins or homemade\n\n\npads after every 4–5 hrs\n\n\nas per the requirement.\n\n\nDispose of the used\n\n\nsanitary napkins\n\n\nproperly wrapping it\n\n\nwith a used paper. Do\n\n\nnot throw the used\n\n\nnapkins in the\n\n\ndrainpipe of toilets or\n\n\nin the open area. After\n\n\nhandling the napkin\n\n\nwash hands with soap.\n\n\nMenstrual Hygiene\nRationalised 2023-24","36\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 2.11\n \nTransport of ovum, fertilisation and passage of growing embryo through fallopian tube\n\n\nmembrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the\n\n\nsecondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results\n\n\nin the formation of a\n \nsecond polar body\n \nand a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon\n\n\nthe haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to\n\n\nform a diploid\n \nzygote\n.\n \nHow many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?\n\n\nOne has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this\n\n\nstage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the\n\n\nhuman female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid\n\n\ngametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas\n\n\nin the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,\n\n\nhence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per\n\n\ncent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote\n\n\nwould carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X\n\n\nor Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female\n\n\nbaby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal\n\n\npatterns in Chapter 5).\n \nThat is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the\n\n\nsex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!\n\n\nThe mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus\n\n\nof the oviduct called\n \ncleavage\n \ntowards the uterus (Figure 2.11) and forms\n\n\n2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called\n \nblastomeres\n. The embryo with 8 to 16\nRationalised 2023-24","37\n\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n\nblastomeres is called a morula (Figure 2.11e). The morula continues to\n\n\ndivide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 2.11g) as it moves further\n\n\ninto the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an\n\n\nouter layer called\n \ntrophoblast\n \nand an inner group of cells attached to\n\n\ntrophoblast called the\n \ninner cell\n \nmass. The trophoblast layer then gets\n\n\nattached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated\n\n\nas the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers\n\n\nthe blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the\n\n\nendometrium of the uterus (Figure 2.11 step\n \nH). This is called\n \nimplantation\n\n\nand it leads to pregnancy.\n\n\n2.6 P\nREGNANCY\n \nAND\n \nE\nMBRYONIC\n \nD\nEVELOPMENT\n\n\nAfter implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called\n\n\nchorionic villi\n \nwhich are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal\n\n\nblood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with\n\n\neach other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between\n\n\ndeveloping embryo (foetus) and maternal body called\n \nplacenta\n \n(Figure 2.12).\n\n\nThe placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the\n\n\nembryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials\n\n\nproduced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through\n\n\nan umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from\n\n\nthe embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces\n\n\nseveral hormones like\n \nhuman chorionic gonadotropin\n \n(hCG),\n \nhuman\n\n\nplacental lactogen\n \n(hPL),\n \nestrogens, progestogens,\n \netc. In the later\n\n\nphase of pregnancy, a hormone called\n \nrelaxin\n \nis also secreted by\n\n\nthe ovary. Let us remember\n\n\nthat hCG, hPL and relaxin\n\n\nare\n \nproduced\n \nin\n \nwomen\n\n\nonly during pregnancy. In\n\n\naddition, during pregnancy\n\n\nthe levels of other hormones\n\n\nlike estrogens, progestogens,\n\n\ncortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,\n\n\netc., are increased several-\n\n\nfolds in the maternal blood.\n\n\nIncreased production of these\n\n\nhormones is essential for\n\n\nsupporting the fetal growth,\n\n\nmetabolic changes in the\n\n\nmother and maintenance of\n\n\npregnancy.\n\n\nImmediately\n \nafter\n\n\nimplantation, the inner cell\n\n\nmass (embryo) differentiates\n \nFigure 2.12\n \nThe human foetus within the uterus\nRationalised 2023-24","38\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ninto an outer layer called\n \nectoderm\n \nand an inner layer called\n \nendoderm\n. A\n\n\nmesoderm\n \nsoon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These\n\n\nthree layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned\n\n\nhere that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called\n \nstem\n \ncells which\n\n\nhave the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n\nWhat are the major features of embryonic development at various\n\n\nmonths of pregnancy?\n \nThe human pregnancy lasts 9 months.\n \nDo you\n\n\nknow for\n \nhow many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats?\n\n\nFind out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s\n\n\nheart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening\n\n\nto the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the\n\n\nsecond month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the\n\n\nend of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are\n\n\nformed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-\n\n\ndeveloped. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on\n\n\nthe head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about\n\n\n24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair,\n\n\neye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed. By the end of nine months\n\n\nof pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.\n\n\n2.7 P\nARTURITION\n \nAND\n \nL\nACTATION\n\n\nThe\n \naverage\n \nduration\n \nof\n \nhuman\n \npregnancy\n \nis\n \nabout\n \n9\n \nmonths\n\n\nwhich is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at\n\n\nthe end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process\n\n\nof delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called\n \nparturition\n. Parturition is\n\n\ninduced\n \nby\n \na\n \ncomplex\n \nneuroendocrine\n \nmechanism.\n \nThe\n \nsignals\n \nfor\n\n\nparturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta\n\n\nwhich induce mild uterine contractions called\n \nfoetal ejection reflex.\n \nThis\n\n\ntriggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on\n\n\nthe uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in\n\n\nturn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between\n\n\nthe uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in\n\n\nstronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby\n\n\nout of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the\n\n\ninfant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus.\n \nWhat do\n\n\nyou think the\n \ndoctors inject to induce delivery?\n\n\nThe mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during\n\n\npregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by\n\n\nthe process called\n \nlactation\n. This helps the mother in feeding the new-\n\n\nborn. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called\n\n\ncolostrum\n \nwhich contains several antibodies absolutely essential to\n\n\ndevelop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the\n\n\ninitial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up\n\n\na healthy baby.\nRationalised 2023-24","39\n\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nHumans\n \nare\n \nsexually\n \nreproducing\n \nand\n \nviviparous.\n \nThe\n \nmale\n\n\nreproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex\n\n\naccessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each\n\n\ntestis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each\n\n\nlobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each\n\n\nseminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.\n\n\nThe spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,\n\n\nwhile Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig\n\n\ncells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular\n\n\nhormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.\n\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair\n\n\nof oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of\n\n\nmammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and\n\n\nsome steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different\n\n\nstages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus\n\n\nand vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers\n\n\nnamely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female\n\n\nexternal genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,\n\n\nhymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female\n\n\nsecondary sexual characteristics.\n\n\nSpermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are\n\n\ntransported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm\n\n\nis composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of\n\n\nformation\n \nof\n \nmature\n \nfemale\n \ngametes\n \nis\n \ncalled\n \noogenesis.\n \nThe\n\n\nreproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.\n\n\nMenstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).\n\n\nDuring ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The\n\n\ncyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle\n\n\nare induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.\n\n\nAfter coitus, sperms are transported to the ampulla, where the sperm\n\n\nfertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence\n\n\nof X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo.\n\n\nThe zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst,\n\n\nwhich is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine\n\n\nmonths of pregnancy, the fully developed\n \nfoetus is ready for delivery.\n\n\nThe process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a\n\n\ncomplex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and\n\n\noxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete\n\n\nmilk after child-birth.

According to the World Health\n\n\nOrganisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total\n\n\nwell-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical,\n\n\nemotional, behavioural and social. Therefore, a society with\n\n\npeople having physically and functionally normal\n\n\nreproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioural\n\n\ninteractions among them in all sex-related aspects might\n\n\nbe called reproductively healthy. Why is it significant to\n\n\nmaintain reproductive health and what are the methods\n\n\ntaken up to achieve it? Let us examine them.\n\n\n3.1 R\nEPRODUCTIVE\n \nH\nEALTH\n \n– P\nROBLEMS\n \nAND\n\n\nS\nTRATEGIES\n\n\nIndia was amongst the first countries in the world to\n\n\ninitiate action plans and programmes at a national level\n\n\nto attain total reproductive health as a social goal.\n\n\nThese\n \nprogrammes\n \ncalled ‘family\n \nplanning’ were\n\n\ninitiated in 1951 and were periodically assessed over\n\n\nthe past decades.

Parents, other\n\n\nclose relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the\n\n\ndissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education\n\n\nin schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to\n\n\nthe young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and\n\n\nhaving misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information\n\n\nabout reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and\n\n\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS,\n\n\netc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to\n\n\nlead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile\n\n\ncouples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth\n\n\ncontrol options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother\n\n\nand child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male\n\n\nand the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up\n\n\nsocially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems\n\n\ndue to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and\n\n\nsex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think\n\n\nand take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a\n\n\nsocially responsible and healthy society.\n\n\nSuccessful implementation of various action plans to attain\n\n\nreproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional\n\n\nexpertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical\n\n\nassistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like\n\n\npregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,\n\n\ninfertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies\n\n\nfrom time to time are also required to provide more efficient care\n\n\nand assistance to people. Statutory ban on\n \namniocentesis\n \nfor\n\n\nsex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides,\n\n\nmassive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit\n\n\nmention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid\n\n\nof the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved\n\n\nsubstances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain\n\n\ngenetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell\n\n\nanemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus.\n\n\nResearch on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and\n\n\nsupported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out\n\n\nnew methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones.\n \nDo you know\n\n\nthat ‘Saheli’–a new oral contraceptive for the females–was developed\nRationalised 2023-24","43\n\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n\nby scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India?\n\n\nBetter awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically\n\n\nassisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal\n\n\nand infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small\n\n\nfamilies, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical\n\n\nfacilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive\n\n\nhealth of the society.\n\n\n3.2 P\nOPULATION\n \nS\nTABILISATION\n \nAND\n \nB\nIRTH\n \nC\nONTROL\n\n\nIn the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly\n\n\nimproved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health\n\n\nfacilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on\n\n\nthe growth of population. The world population which was around\n\n\n2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and\n\n\n7.2 billion in 2011. A similar trend was observed in India too. Our\n\n\npopulation which was approximately 350 million at the time of our\n\n\nindependence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed\n\n\n1.2 billion in May 2011. A rapid decline in death rate,\n \nmaternal mortality\n\n\nrate\n \n(MMR) and\n \ninfant mortality rate\n \n(IMR) as well as an increase in\n\n\nnumber of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this.\n\n\nThrough our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we\n\n\ncould bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was\n\n\nless than 2 per cent, i.e., 20/1000/year, a rate at which our population\n\n\ncould increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an\n\n\nabsolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and\n\n\nclothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,\n\n\nthe government was forced to take up serious measures to check this\n\n\npopulation growth rate.\n\n\nThe most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller\n\n\nfamilies by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen\n\n\nadvertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy\n\n\ncouple with two children with a slogan\n \nHum Do Hamare Do\n \n(we two, our\n\n\ntwo). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even\n\n\nadopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the\n\n\nfemale to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to\n\n\ncouples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle\n\n\nthis problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive\n\n\nmethods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\n\nAn ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available,\n\n\neffective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no\n\n\nway interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the\n\n\nuser. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which\n\n\ncould be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely\n\n\nNatural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,\n\n\nImplants and Surgical methods.\nRationalised 2023-24","44\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 3.2.\n \nCopper T (CuT)\n\n\nNatural methods\n \nwork on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum\n\n\nand sperms meeting.\n \nPeriodic abstinence\n \nis one such method in which\n\n\nthe couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual\n\n\ncycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are\n\n\nvery high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by\n\n\nabstaining from coitus during this period, conception could\n\n\nbe prevented.\n \nWithdrawal\n \nor\n \ncoitus interruptus\n \nis another\n\n\nmethod in which the male partner withdraws his penis from\n\n\nthe\n \nvagina\n \njust\n \nbefore\n \nejaculation\n \nso\n \nas\n \nto\n \navoid\n\n\ninsemination.\n \nLactational amenorrhea\n \n(absence of\n\n\nmenstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation\n\n\nand therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of\n\n\nintense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long\n\n\nas the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of\n\n\nconception are almost nil. However, this method has been\n\n\nreported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six\n\n\nmonths following parturition. As no medicines or devices\n\n\nare used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.\n\n\nChances of failure, though, of this method are also high.\n\n\nIn\n \nbarrier\n \nmethods, ovum and sperms are prevented\n\n\nfrom physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such\n\n\nmethods\n \nare available for both males and females.\n\n\nCondoms\n \n(Figure 3.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/\n\n\nlatex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or\n\n\nvagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that\n\n\nthe ejaculated semen would not enter into the female\n\n\nreproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is\n\n\na popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms\n\n\nhas increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of\n\n\nprotecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both\n\n\nthe male and the female condoms are disposable, can be\n\n\nself-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user.\n\n\nDiaphragms, cervical caps\n \nand\n \nvaults\n \nare also barriers\n\n\nmade of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive\n\n\ntract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent\n\n\nconception by blocking the entry of sperms through the\n\n\ncervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and\n\n\nfoams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase\n\n\ntheir contraceptive efficiency.\n\n\nAnother effective and popular method is the use of\n \nIntra Uterine\n\n\nDevices (IUDs)\n. These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses\n\n\nin the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently\n\n\navailable as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing\n\n\nIUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs\n\n\n(Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 3.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms\n\n\nwithin the uterus and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility and\n\n\nthe fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition,\n\n\nFigure 3.1(b)\n \nCondom for female\n\n\nFigure 3.1(a)\n \nCondom for male\nRationalised 2023-24","45\n\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n\nmake the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the\n\n\ncervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives\n\n\nfor the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space\n\n\nchildren. It is one of most widely accepted methods of\n\n\ncontraception in India.\n\n\nOral administration of small doses of either progestogens\n\n\nor\n \nprogestogen –estrogen\n \ncombinations\n \nis\n \nanother\n\n\ncontraceptive method used by the females. They are used\n\n\nin the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the\n\n\npills\n. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days\n\n\nstarting preferably within the first five days of menstrual\n\n\ncycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation\n\n\noccurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to\n\n\nprevent conception. They inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as\n\n\nalter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. Pills\n\n\nare very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females.\n\n\nSaheli\n \n–the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal\n\n\npreparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill with very few side effects and high\n\n\ncontraceptive value.\n\n\nProgestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used\n\n\nby females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 3.3). Their\n\n\nmode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are\n\n\nmuch longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen\n\n\ncombinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be\n\n\nvery effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid\n\n\npossible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse.\n\n\nSurgical methods, also called\n \nsterilisation\n, are generally advised for\n\n\nthe male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more\n\n\nFigure 3.3\n \nImplants\n\n\nFigure 3.4 (a)\n \nVasectomy\n \nFigure 3.4 (b)\n \nTubectomy\nRationalised 2023-24","46\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\npregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby\n\n\nprevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy’\n\n\nand that in the female, ‘tubectomy’. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas\n\n\ndeferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum\n\n\n(Figure 3.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is\n\n\nremoved (Figure 3.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen\n\n\nor through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their\n\n\nreversibility is very poor.\n\n\nIt needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive\n\n\nmethod and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with\n\n\nqualified medical professionals. One must also remember that\n\n\ncontraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of\n\n\nreproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural\n\n\nreproductive event, i.e., conception/pregnancy. One is forced to use these\n\n\nmethods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due\n\n\nto personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have\n\n\na significant role in checking uncontrolled growth of population. However,\n\n\ntheir possible ill-effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough\n\n\nbleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding or even breast cancer, though not\n\n\nvery significant, should not be totally ignored.\n\n\n3.3 M\nEDICAL\n \nT\nERMINATION\n \nOF\n \nP\nREGNANCY\n \n(MTP)\n\n\nIntentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called\n\n\nmedical termination\n \nof\n \npregnancy\n \n(MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly\n\n\n45 to 50 million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which\n\n\naccounts to 1/5th of the total number of conceived pregnancies in a year.\n\n\nWhether to accept /\n \nlegalise MTP or not is being debated upon in many\n\n\ncountries due to emotional, ethical, religious and social issues involved\n\n\nin it. Government of India legalised MTP in 1971 with some strict conditions\n\n\nto avoid its misuse. Such restrictions are all the more important to check\n\n\nindiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high\n\n\nin India.\n\n\nWhy MTP ? Obviously the answer is – to get rid of unwanted\n\n\npregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the\n\n\ncontraceptive used during coitus or rapes. MTPs are also essential in\n\n\ncertain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or\n\n\neven fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both.\n\n\nMTPs are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto\n\n\n12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier.\n\n\nOne disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed\n\n\nillegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be\n\n\nfatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to\n\n\ndetermine the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the foetus is found\n\n\nto be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal.\n\n\nThe Medical Termination\n\n\nof Pregnancy\n\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2017\n\n\nwas enacted by the\n\n\ngovernment of India with\n\n\nthe intension of\n\n\nreducing the incidence of\n\n\nillegal abortion and\n\n\nconsequent maternal\n\n\nmortality and morbidity.\n\n\nAccording to this Act, a\n\n\npregnancy may be\n\n\nterminated on certain\n\n\nconsidered grounds\n\n\nwithin the first 12 weeks\n\n\nof pregnancy on the\n\n\nopinion of one registered\n\n\nmedical practitioner. If\n\n\nthe pregnancy has lasted\n\n\nmore than 12 weeks, but\n\n\nfewer than 24 weeks, two\n\n\nregistered medical\n\n\npractitioners must be of\n\n\nthe opinion, formed in\n\n\ngood faith, that the\n\n\nrequired ground exist.\n\n\nThe grounds for such\n\n\ntermination of\n\n\npregnancies are:\n\n\n(i)\n \nThe continuation of\n\n\nthe pregnancy would\n\n\ninvolve a risk to the\n\n\nlife of the pregnant\n\n\nwoman or of grave\n\n\ninjury physical or\n\n\nmental health; or\n\n\n(ii\n \nThere is a\n\n\nsubstantial risk that\n\n\nof the child were\n\n\nborn, it would suffer\n\n\nfrom such physical\n\n\nor mental\n\n\nabnormalities as to\n\n\nbe seriously\n\n\nhandicapped.\nRationalised 2023-24","47\n\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n\nSuch practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for\n\n\nthe young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need to\n\n\navoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions\n\n\nas well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned\n\n\nunhealthy trend.\n\n\n3.4 S\nEXUALLY\n \nT\nRANSMITTED\n \nI\nNFECTIONS\n \n(STI\nS\n)\n\n\nInfections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse\n\n\nare collectively called sexually transmitted infections\n \n(STI) or venereal\n\n\ndiseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis,\n\n\ngenital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B\n\n\nand of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading\n\n\nto AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is\n\n\nmost dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.\n\n\nSome of these infections like hepatitis–B and HIV can also be\n\n\ntransmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,\n\n\nwith infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to\n\n\nthe foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,\n\n\nother diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated\n\n\nproperly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,\n\n\nfluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected\n\n\nfemales may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected\n\n\nfor long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of\n\n\ninfection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected\n\n\npersons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could\n\n\nlead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases\n\n\n(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer\n\n\nof the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.\n\n\nTherefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are\n\n\ngiven prime consideration under the reproductive health-care\n\n\nprogrammes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their\n\n\nincidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group\n\n\nof 15-24 years – the age group to which you also belong. There is no\n\n\nreason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these\n\n\ninfections by following the simple principles given below:\n\n\n(i)\n \nAvoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nAlways try to use condoms during coitus.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nIn case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early\n\n\ndetection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection.\n\n\n3.5 I\nNFERTILITY\n\n\nA discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of\n\n\ninfertility. A large number of couples all over the world including India\n\n\nare infertile, i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected\nRationalised 2023-24","48\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nsexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many–physical,\n\n\ncongenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological.\n\n\nIn India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but\n\n\nmore often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised\n\n\nhealth care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and\n\n\ncorrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to\n\n\nhave children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples\n\n\ncould be assisted to have children through certain special techniques\n\n\ncommonly known as\n \nassisted reproductive technologies\n \n(ART).\n\n\nIn vitro\n \nfertilisation\n \n(IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost\n\n\nsimilar conditions as that in the body) followed by\n \nembryo transfer\n \n(ET)\n\n\nis one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as\n \ntest tube\n\n\nbaby\n \nprogramme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the\n\n\nhusband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under\n\n\nsimulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with\n\n\nupto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube\n\n\n(ZIFT\n–zygote intra fallopian transfer\n) and embryos with more than\n\n\n8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT\n \n– intra uterine transfer\n), to complete\n\n\nits further development. Embryos formed by\n \nin-vivo\n \nfertilisation\n \n(fusion\n\n\nof gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist\n\n\nthose females who cannot conceive.\n\n\nTransfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube\n\n\n(GIFT –\n \ngamete intra fallopian transfer\n) of another female who cannot\n\n\nproduce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and\n\n\nfurther development is another method attempted.\n \nIntra cytoplasmic\n\n\nsperm injection\n \n(ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo\n\n\nin the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.\n\n\nInfertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate\n\n\nthe female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be\n\n\ncorrected by\n \nartificial insemination\n \n(AI) technique. In this technique,\n\n\nthe semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially\n\n\nintroduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI –\n \nintra-uterine\n\n\ninsemination\n) of the female.\n\n\nThough options are many, all these techniques require extremely high\n\n\nprecision handling by specialised professionals and expensive\n\n\ninstrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in\n\n\nvery few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to\n\n\nonly a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social factors\n\n\nare also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the ultimate\n\n\naim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many\n\n\norphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till\n\n\nmaturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is\n\n\nas yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood.\nRationalised 2023-24","49\n\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nReproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of\n\n\nreproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our\n\n\nnation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans\n\n\nat national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society.\n\n\nCounselling\n \nand\n \ncreating\n \nawareness\n \namong\n \npeople\n \nabout\n\n\nreproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and\n\n\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\n\nincluding AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health.\n\n\nProviding medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual\n\n\nirregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination\n\n\nof pregnancy, STIs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and\n\n\nmaternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive\n\n\nand Child Health Care programmes.\n\n\nAn overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in\n\n\nour country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality\n\n\nrates, early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples,\n\n\netc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an\n\n\nexplosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense\n\n\npropagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options\n\n\nare available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills,\n\n\ninjectables, implants and surgical methods.

Gregor Mendel, conducted\n\n\nhybridisation experiments on garden peas for\n\n\nseven years (1856-1863) and proposed the\n\n\nlaws of inheritance in living organisms. During\n\n\nMendel’s investigations into inheritance\n\n\npatterns it was for the first time that statistical\n\n\nanalysis and mathematical logic were applied\n\n\nto problems in biology. His experiments had a\n\n\nlarge sampling size, which gave greater\n\n\ncredibility to the data that he collected. Also,\n\n\nthe confirmation of his inferences from\n\n\nexperiments on successive generations of his\n\n\ntest plants, proved that his results pointed to\n\n\ngeneral rules of inheritance rather than being\n\n\nunsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated\n\n\ncharacters in the garden pea plant that were\n\n\nmanifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or\n\n\ndwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This\n\n\nallowed him to set up a basic framework of\n\n\nrules governing inheritance, which was\n\n\nexpanded on by later scientists to account for\n\n\nall the diverse natural observations and the\n\n\ncomplexity inherent in them.\n\n\nMendel\n \nconducted\n \nsuch\n \nartificial\n\n\npollination/cross pollination experiments\n\n\nusing several true-breeding pea lines. A true-\n\n\nbreeding line is one that, having undergone\n\n\ncontinuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and\n\n\nexpression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea\n\n\nplant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with\n\n\ncontrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or\n\n\nwrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green\n\n\nor yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 4.1, Table 4.1).\n\n\nFigure 4.1\n \nSeven pairs of contrasting traits in\n\n\npea plant studied by Mendel\nRationalised 2023-24","55\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\n4.2 I\nNHERITANCE\n \nOF\n \nO\nNE\n \nG\nENE\n\n\nLet\n \nus\n \ntake\n \nthe\n \nexample\n \nof\n \none\n \nsuch\n\n\nhybridisation experiment carried out by\n\n\nMendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea\n\n\nplants to study the inheritance of one gene\n\n\n(Figure 4.2).

He called\n\n\nthese things as ‘factors’. Now we call\n\n\nthem as\n \ngenes\n. Genes, therefore, are\n\n\nthe units of inheritance. They\n\n\ncontain the information that is\n\n\nrequired to express a particular trait\n\n\nin an organism. Genes which code\n\n\nfor a pair of contrasting traits are\n\n\nknown as\n \nalleles,\n \ni.e., they are\n\n\nslightly different forms of the same\n\n\ngene.\n\n\nIf we use alphabetical symbols\n\n\nfor each gene, then the capital letter\n\n\nis used for the trait expressed at the\n\n\nF\n1\n \nstage and the small alphabet for\n\n\nthe other trait.

What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a\n\n\ngenotype\n \nTt\n?\n\n\nAs Mendel found the phenotype of the F\n1\n \nheterozygote\n \nTt\n \nto be exactly\n\n\nlike the\n \nTT\n \nparent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar\n\n\nfactors, one dominates the other (as in the F\n1\n \n) and hence is called the\n\n\ndominant\n \nfactor while the other factor is\n \nrecessive\n \n. In this case\n \nT\n \n(for\n\n\ntallness) is dominant over\n \nt\n \n(for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed\n\n\nidentical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied.\n\n\nIt is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an\n\n\nalphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and\n\n\nrecessiveness. (Do not use\n \nT\n \nfor tall and\n \nd\n \nfor dwarf because you will\n\n\nfind it difficult to remember whether\n \nT\n \nand\n \nd\n \nare alleles of the same\n\n\ngene/character or not).

This segregation of alleles\n\n\nis a random process and so there is a 50 per cent\n\n\nchance of a gamete containing either allele, as has\n\n\nbeen verified by the results of the crossings. In this\n\n\nway the gametes of the tall\n \nTT\n \nplants have the allele\n\n\nT\n \nand the gametes of the dwarf\n \ntt\n \nplants have the\n\n\nallele\n \nt\n. During fertilisation the two alleles,\n \nT\n \nfrom\n\n\none parent say, through the pollen, and\n \nt\n \nfrom the\n\n\nother parent, then through the egg, are united to\n\n\nproduce zygotes that have one\n \nT\n \nallele and one\n \nt\n\n\nallele.\n \nIn other words the hybrids have\n \nTt\n. Since\n\n\nthese hybrids contain alleles which express\n\n\ncontrasting traits, the plants are\n \nheterozygous\n. The\n\n\nproduction of gametes by the parents, the formation\n\n\nof the zygotes, the F\n1\n \nand F\n2\n \nplants can be\n\n\nunderstood from a diagram called\n \nPunnett\n\n\nSquare\n \nas shown in Figure 4.4.

As a result of\n\n\nrandom fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can be of the genotypes\n \nTT\n,\n \nTt\n\n\nor\n \ntt.\n\n\nFrom the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4\nth\n \nof the random\n\n\nfertilisations lead to\n \nTT\n, 1/2 lead to\n \nTt\n \nand 1/4\nth\n \nto\n \ntt\n. Though the F\n1\n\n\nhave a genotype of\n \nTt\n, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F\n2\n,\n\n\n3/4\nth\n \nof the plants are tall, where some of them are\n \nTT\n \nwhile others are\n \nTt\n.\n\n\nExternally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with the\n\n\ngenotypes\n \nTT\n \nand\n \nTt\n. Hence, within the genopytic pair\n \nTt\n \nonly one character\n\n\n‘\nT\n \n’ tall is expressed. Hence the character\n \nT\n \nor ‘tall’ is said to dominate over\n\n\nthe other allele\n \nt\n \nor ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this dominance of\n\n\none character over the other that all the F\n1\n \nare tall (though the genotype is\n\n\nTt\n) and in the F\n2\n \n3/4\nth\n \nof the plants are tall (though genotypically 1/2\n \nare\n\n\nTt\n \nand only 1/4\nth\n \nare\n \nTT\n).

He concluded\n\n\nthat the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous –\n \ntt\n. What do you think\n\n\nhe would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F\n2\n \nplant?\n\n\nFrom the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic\n\n\nratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking\n\n\nat the phenotype of a dominant trait, it\n \nis not possible to know the\n\n\ngenotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F\n1\n\n\nor F\n2\n \nhas\n \nTT\n \nor\n \nTt\n \ncomposition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine\n\n\nthe genotype of a tall plant at F\n2\n, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F\n2\n\n\nwith a dwarf plant. This he called a\n \ntest cross\n. In a typical test cross an\n\n\norganism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose\n\n\ngenotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead\n\n\nof self-crossing.

The\n\n\ninheritance of flower colour in the dog flower\n\n\n(snapdragon or\n \nAntirrhinum sp.\n) is a good example\n\n\nto understand incomplete dominance. In a cross\n\n\nbetween true-breeding red-flowered\n \n(RR)\n \nand true-\n\n\nbreeding white-flowered plants\n \n(rr)\n, the F\n1\n \n(Rr)\n \nwas\n\n\npink (Figure 4.6).

Here the genotype ratios were\n\n\nexactly as we would expect in any mendelian\n\n\nmonohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had\n\n\nchanged from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.\n\n\nWhat happened was that\n \nR\n \nwas not completely\n\n\ndominant over\n \nr\n \nand this\n \nmade it possible to\n\n\ndistinguish\n \nRr\n \nas pink from\n \nRR\n \n(red) and\n \nrr\n \n(white) .\n\n\nExplanation of the concept of dominance\n:\n\n\nWhat exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles\n\n\ndominant and some recessive? To tackle these\n\n\nquestions, we must understand what a gene does.\n\n\nEvery gene, as you know by now, contains the\n\n\ninformation to express a particular trait. In a\n\n\ndiploid organism, there are two copies of each\n\n\ngene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles\n\n\nneed not always be identical, as in a heterozygote.\n\n\nOne of them may be different due to some changes\n\n\nthat it has undergone (about which you will read\n\n\nfurther on, and in the next chapter) which modifies\n\n\nthe information that particular allele contains.\n\n\nLet’s take an example of a gene that contains\n\n\nthe information for producing an enzyme. Now\n\n\nthere are two copies of this gene, the two allelic\n\n\nforms. Let us assume (as is more common) that\n\n\nthe normal allele produces the normal enzyme\n\n\nthat is needed for the transformation of a\n\n\nsubstrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for\n\n\nproduction of –\n\n\n(i) the normal/less efficient enzyme, or\n\n\n(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or\n\n\n(iii) no enzyme at all\n\n\nFigure 4.6\n \nResults of monohybrid cross in\n\n\nthe plant Snapdragon, where\n\n\none\n \nallele\n \nis\n \nincompletely\n\n\ndominant over the other allele\nRationalised 2023-24","61\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\nIn the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele,\n\n\ni.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation\n\n\nof substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the\n\n\nallele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may\n\n\nbe effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning\n\n\nof the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents\n\n\nthe original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is\n\n\ngenerally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait\n\n\nis seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced.\n\n\n4.2.2.2 Co-dominance\n\n\nTill now we were discussing crosses where the F\n1\n \nresembled either of the\n\n\ntwo parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But,\n\n\nin the case of co-dominance the\n \nF\n1\n \ngeneration resembles both parents. A\n\n\ngood example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO\n\n\nblood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by\n\n\nthe gene\n \nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers\n\n\nthat protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the\n\n\ngene\n.\n \nThe gene\n \n(\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n)\n \nhas three alleles\n \nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n,\n \nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\n \nand\n \ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n.

Hence red blood cells have\n\n\nboth A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there\n\n\nare six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and\n\n\ntherefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types\n\n\n(Table 4.2).\n \nHow many phenotypes are possible?\n\n\nTable 4.2: Table Showing the Genetic Basis of Blood Groups\n\n\nin Human Population\n\n\nAllele from\n \nAllele from\n \nGenotype of\n \nBlood\n\n\nParent 1\n \nParent 2\n \noffspring\n \ntypes of\n\n\noffspring\n\n\nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nA\n \nA\n\n\nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nB\n \nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nB\n \nA B\n\n\nI\n \nA\n \ni\n \nI\n \nA\n \ni\n \nA\n\n\nI\n \nB\n \nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nA\n \nI\n \nB\n \nA B\n\n\nI\n \nB\n \nI\n \nB\n \nI\n \nB\n \nI\n \nB\n \nB\n\n\nI\n \nB\n \ni\n \nI\n \nB\n \ni\n \nB\n\n\ni\n \ni\n \ni i\n \nO\nRationalised 2023-24","62\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nDo you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides\n\n\na good example of\n \nmultiple alleles\n? Here you\n \ncan see that there are\n\n\nmore than two, i.e., three alleles, governing the same character. Since in\n\n\nan individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found\n\n\nonly when population studies are made.\n\n\nOccasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect.\n\n\nFor example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It\n\n\nhas two alleles (\nB\n \nand\n \nb\n). Starch is synthesised effectively by\n \nB B\n\n\nhomozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,\n\n\nb b\n \nhomozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce\n\n\nsmaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds,\n \nB B\n \nseeds are round\n\n\nand the\n \nb b\n \nseeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and\n\n\nso\n \nB\n \nseems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are\n\n\nof intermediate size in\n \nB b\n \nseeds. So if starch grain size is considered as\n\n\nthe phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete\n\n\ndominance.\n\n\nTherefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the\n\n\nproduct that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene\n\n\nproduct and the production of a particular phenotype from this product\n\n\nas it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case\n\n\nmore than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene.\n\n\n4.3 I\nNHERITANCE\n \nOF\n \nT\nWO\n \nG\nENES\n\n\nMendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two\n\n\ncharacters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with\n\n\nyellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour\n\n\nand wrinkled shape (Figure 4.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting\n\n\nfrom the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped\n\n\nseeds.\n \nHere can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/\n\n\ngreen colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant?\n\n\nThus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape\n\n\ndominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got\n\n\nwhen he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green\n\n\nseeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants.\n\n\nLet us use the genotypic symbols\n \nY\n \nfor dominant yellow seed colour\n\n\nand\n \ny\n \nfor recessive green seed colour,\n \nR\n \nfor round shaped seeds and\n \nr\n \nfor\n\n\nwrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as\n\n\nRRYY\n \nand\n \nrryy\n. The cross between the two plants can be written down\n\n\nas in Figure 4.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes\n\n\nRY\n \nand\n \nry\n \nunite on fertilisation to produce the F\n1\n \nhybrid\n \nRrYy\n. When\n\n\nMendel self hybridised the F\n1\n \nplants he found that 3/4\nth\n \nof F\n2\n \nplants had\n\n\nyellow seeds and 1/4\nth\n \nhad green. The yellow and green colour segregated\n\n\nin a 3:1 ratio.

Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters\n\n\nthat Mendel studied.\n\n\nThe ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow:\n\n\n1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written\n\n\nas follows:\n\n\n(3 Round : 1 Wrinkled)\n \n(3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3\n\n\nWrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green\n\n\nBased upon such observations on\n \ndihybrid crosses\n \n(crosses between\n\n\nplants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations\n\n\nthat we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that\n\n\n‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair\n\n\nof characters is independent of the other pair of characters’.\n\n\nThe Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the\n\n\nindependent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and\n\n\nthe production of eggs and pollen in the F\n1\n \nRrYy\n \nplant. Consider the\n\n\nsegregation of one pair of genes\n \nR\n \nand\n \nr\n. Fifty per cent of the gametes\n\n\nhave the gene\n \nR\n \nand the other 50 per cent have\n \nr\n. Now besides each\n\n\ngamete having either\n \nR\n \nor\n \nr\n, it should also have the allele\n \nY\n \nor\n \ny\n. The\n\n\nimportant thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent\n \nR\n\n\nand 50 per cent\n \nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n \nis\n \nindependent\n \nfrom the segregation of 50 per cent\n\n\nY\n \nand 50 per cent\n \ny\n. Therefore, 50 per cent of the\n \nr\n \nbearing gametes\n\n\nhas\n \nY\n \nand the other 50 per cent has\n \ny\n. Similarly, 50 per cent of the\n \nR\n\n\nbearing gametes has\n \nY\n \nand the other 50 per cent has\n \ny\n. Thus there are\n\n\nfour genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs).\n\n\nThe four types are\n \nRY\n,\n \nRy\n,\n \nr\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n \nand\n \nry\n \neach with a frequency of 25 per\n\n\ncent or 1/4\nth\n \nof the total gametes produced.

Firstly,\nRationalised 2023-24","65\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\ncommunication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work\n\n\ncould not be widely publicised.\n \nSecondly, his concept of\n \ngenes\n \n(or\n\n\nfactors\n, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled\n\n\nthe expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’\n\n\nwith each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an\n\n\nexplanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature.\n\n\nThirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological\n\n\nphenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the\n\n\nbiologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that\n\n\nfactors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical\n\n\nproof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of.\n\n\nIn 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak)\n\n\nindependently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of\n\n\ncharacters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that\n\n\nwere taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division.\n\n\nThis led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to\n\n\ndouble and divide just before each cell division. These were called\n\n\nchromosomes\n \n(\ncolored bodies\n, as they were visualised by staining). By\n\n\n1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out.\n\n\nWalter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of\n\n\nchromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used\n\n\nchromosome movement (Figure 4.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 4.3).\n\n\nRecall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis\n\n\n(equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The\n\n\nimportant things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes\n\n\noccur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous\n\n\nsites on homologous chromosomes.\n\n\nFigure 4.8\n \nMeiosis and germ cell formation in a cell with four chromosomes.\n\n\nCan you see how chromosomes segregate when germ cells\n\n\nare formed?\nRationalised 2023-24","66\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nPossibility I\n \nPossibility II\n\n\nOne long orange and short green\n \nOne long orange and short red\n\n\nchromosome and long yellow and\n \nchromosome and long yellow and\n\n\nshort red chromosome at the\n \nshort green chromosome at the\n\n\nsame pole\n \nsame pole\n\n\nFigure 4.9\n \nIndependent assortment of chromosomes\n\n\nCa n\n \nyou\n \ntell\n \nwhich\n \nof\n \nthese\n \ncolumns\n \nA\n \nor\n \nB\n \nrepresent\n \nthe\n\n\nchromosome and which represents the gene?

To\n\n\nunderstand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in\n\n\nthe left and right columns. In the left column (Possibility I) orange and\n\n\ngreen is segregating together.

They could be grown on\n\n\nsimple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life\n\n\ncycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large\n\n\nnumber of progeny flies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of the\n\n\nsexes – the male and female flies are easily distinguishable. Also, it\n\n\nhas many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low\n\n\npower microscopes.\n\n\n4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination\n\n\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in\n \nDrosophila\n \nto study genes\n\n\nthat were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried\n\n\nout by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,\n\n\nwhite-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their\n\n\nF\n1\n \nprogeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently\n\n\nof each other and the F\n2\n \nratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1\n\n\nratio (expected when the two genes are independent).\n\n\nMorgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X\n\n\nchromosome (Section 4.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a\n\n\ndihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion\n\n\nof parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental\n\n\ntype. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage\n\n\nof the two genes and coined the term\n \nlinkage\n \nto describe this physical\n\n\nassociation of genes on a chromosome and the term\n \nrecombination\n \nto\n\n\ndescribe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11).\n\n\nMorgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped\n\n\non the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed\n\n\nvery low recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross A) while others were loosely\n\n\nlinked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross B). For\n\n\nexample he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked\n\n\nand showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white\n \nand miniature\n\n\nwing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred\n\n\nSturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs\n\n\non the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes\n\n\nand ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome.

But if you\n\n\nlook around you will find that there are many traits which are not so\n\n\ndistinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example,\n\n\nin humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct\n\n\nalternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally\n\n\ncontrolled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits.\n\n\nBesides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes\n\n\ninto account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another\n\n\nclassic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the\n\n\ncontribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To\n\n\nunderstand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin\n\n\ncolour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for\n\n\ndark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour.\n\n\nThe genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest\n\n\nskin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the\n\n\nlightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles\n\n\nand three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this\n\n\nmanner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine\n\n\nthe darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual.\n\n\n4.5 P\nLEIOTROPY\n\n\nWe have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait.\n\n\nThere are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple\n\n\nphenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The\n\n\nunderlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene\n\n\non metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes.\n\n\nAn example of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in\n\n\nhumans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the\n\n\nenzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests\n\n\nitself\n \nthrough\n \nphenotypic\n \nexpression\n \ncharacterised\n \nby\n \nmental\n\n\nretardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.\n\n\n4.6 S\nEX\n \nD\nETERMINATION\n\n\nThe mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the\n\n\ngeneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism\n\n\nof sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried\n\n\nout in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of\n\n\ninsects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal\n\n\nbasis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear\n\n\nstructure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also\n\n\nobserved by him that 50 per\n \ncent of the sperm received this structure\n\n\nafter spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive\n\n\nit. Henking gave a name to this structure as the\n \nX body\n \nbut he could not\n\n\nexplain its significance. Further investigations by other scientists led to\n\n\nthe conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome\nRationalised 2023-24","70\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nand that is why it was given the name\n\n\nX-chromosome. It was also observed that in\n\n\na large number of insects the mechanism of\n\n\nsex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all\n\n\neggs bear an additional X-chromosome\n\n\nbesides\n \nthe\n \nother\n \nchromosomes\n\n\n(autosomes). On the other hand, some of the\n\n\nsperms bear the X-chromosome whereas\n\n\nsome do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having\n\n\nan X-chromosome become females and,\n\n\nthose fertilised by sperms that do not have\n\n\nan X-chromosome become males.\n \nDo you\n\n\nthink the number of chromosomes in the\n\n\nmale and female are equal?\n \nDue to the\n\n\ninvolvement of the X-chromosome in the\n\n\ndetermination of sex, it was designated to\n\n\nbe the\n \nsex chromosome\n, and the rest of the\n\n\nchromosomes\n \nwere\n \nnamed\n \nas\n\n\nautosomes\n.Grasshopper is an example of\n\n\nXO type of sex determination in which the\n\n\nmales have only one X-chromosome besides\n\n\nthe autosomes, whereas females have a pair\n\n\nof X-chromosomes.\n\n\nThese\n \nobservations\n \nled\n \nto\n \nthe\n\n\ninvestigation of a number of species to\n\n\nunderstand\n \nthe\n \nmechanism\n \nof\n \nsex\n\n\ndetermination. In a number of other insects\n\n\nand mammals including man, XY type of sex\n\n\ndetermination is seen where both male and\n\n\nfemale have same number of chromosomes.\n\n\nAmong the males an X-chromosome is\n\n\npresent but its counter part is distinctly\n\n\nsmaller and called the Y-chromosome.\n\n\nFemales,\n \nhowever,\n \nhave\n \na\n \npair\n \nof\n \nX-\n\n\nchromosomes. Both males and females bear\n\n\nsame number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY,\n\n\nwhile female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings\n \nand in\n\n\nDrosophila\n \nthe males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females\n\n\nhave a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 4.12 a, b).\n\n\nIn the above description you have studied about two types of sex\n\n\ndetermining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases\n\n\nmales produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without\n\n\nX-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with\n\n\nY-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated\n\n\nto be the example of\n \nmale heterogamety\n. In some other organisms, e.g.,\n\n\nbirds, a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure\n\n\n4.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both\n\n\nmales and females. But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nFigure 4.12\n \nDetermination of sex by chromosomal\n\n\ndifferences: (a,b) Both in humans and\n\n\nin\n \nDrosophila\n, the female has a pair of\n\n\nXX chromosomes (homogametic) and the\n\n\nmale XY (heterogametic) composition;\n\n\n(c) In many birds, female has a pair of\n\n\ndissimilar chromosomes ZW and male\n\n\ntwo similar ZZ chromosomes\nRationalised 2023-24","71\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\nchromosomes, are produced by females, i.e.,\n \nfemale heterogamety\n.\n \nIn\n\n\norder to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination\n\n\ndescribed earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has\n\n\nbeen designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the\n\n\nfemales have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of\n\n\nZ-chromosomes besides the autosomes.\n\n\n4.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans\n\n\nIt has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in\n\n\ncase of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present,\n\n\n22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the\n\n\nautosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas\n\n\nthe presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male\n\n\ncharacteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of\n\n\ngametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry\n\n\nthe X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides\n\n\nthe autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with\n\n\nan X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the\n\n\novum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the\n\n\novum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops\n\n\ninto a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome\n\n\ncarrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it\n\n\nis the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child.\n\n\nIt is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent\n\n\nprobability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in\n\n\nour society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and\n\n\nhave been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion.\n\n\n4.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee\n\n\nThe sex determination in honey bee is\n\n\nbased\n \non\n \nthe\n \nnumber\n \nof\n \nsets\n \nof\n\n\nchromosomes an individual receives. An\n\n\noffspring formed from the union of a\n\n\nsperm and an egg develops as a female\n\n\n(queen or worker), and an unfertilised\n\n\negg develops as a male (drone) by means\n\n\nof parthenogenesis. This means that the\n\n\nmales\n \nhave\n \nhalf\n \nthe\n \nnumber\n \nof\n\n\nchromosomes than that of a female. The\n\n\nfemales\n \nare\n \ndiploid\n \nhaving\n \n32\n\n\nchromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes.\n\n\nThis is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special\n\n\ncharacteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis\n\n\n(Figure 4.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but\n\n\nhave a grandfather and can have grandsons.\n\n\nHow is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds?\n\n\nIs the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks?\n\n\nFigure 4.13\n \nSex determination in honey bee\nRationalised 2023-24","72\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\n4.7 M\nUTATION\n\n\nMutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences\n\n\nand consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype\n\n\nof an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another\n\n\nphenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.\n\n\nAs you will learn in Chapter 5, one DNA helix runs continuously from\n\n\none end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form.\n\n\nTherefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of\n\n\nDNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be\n\n\nlocated on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in\n\n\nabnormalities\n \nor\n \naberrations.\n \nChromosomal\n\n\naberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.\n\n\nIn addition to the above, mutation also arise due\n\n\nto change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known\n\n\nas point mutation. A classical example of such a\n\n\nmutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions\n\n\nof base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations\n\n\n(see Chapter 5).\n\n\nThe mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope\n\n\nof this discussion, at this level. However, there are\n\n\nmany chemical and physical factors that induce\n\n\nmutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV\n\n\nradiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a\n\n\nmutagen.\n\n\n4.8 G\nENETIC\n \nD\nISORDERS\n\n\n4.8.1 Pedigree Analysis\n\n\nThe idea that disorders are inherited has been\n\n\nprevailing in the human society since long. This was\n\n\nbased on the heritability of certain characteristic\n\n\nfeatures in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s\n\n\nwork the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of\n\n\ntraits in human beings began. Since it is evident that\n\n\ncontrol crosses that can be performed in pea plant or\n\n\nsome other organisms, are not possible in case of\n\n\nhuman beings, study of the family history about\n\n\ninheritance of a particular trait provides an\n\n\nalternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family\n\n\nis called the\n \npedigree analysis\n. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance\n\n\nof a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations.\n\n\nIn human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is\n\n\nutilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease.\n\n\nSome of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis\n\n\nhave been shown in Figure 4.13.\n\n\nAs you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any\n\n\norganism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present\n\n\nFigure 4.13\n \nSymbols used in the human\n\n\npedigree analysis\nRationalised 2023-24","73\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\nin the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence\n\n\ntransmitted from one generation to the other without any change or\n\n\nalteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such\n\n\nan alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation.\n\n\nA number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated\n\n\nwith the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes.\n\n\n4.8.2 Mendelian Disorders\n\n\nBroadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian\n\n\ndisorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly\n\n\ndetermined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders\n\n\nare transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in\n\n\nthe principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian\n\n\ndisorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common\n\n\nand prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-\n\n\ncell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is\n\n\nimportant to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be\n\n\ndominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand\n\n\nwhether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait\n\n\nmay also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is\n\n\nevident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier\n\n\nfemale to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 4.14\n\n\nfor dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design\n\n\npedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\n\n\nFigure 4.14\n \nRepresentative pedigree analysis of (a) Autosomal dominant trait (for example:\n\n\nMyotonic dystrophy) (b) Autosomal recessive trait (for example: Sickle-cell anaemia)\n\n\nColour Blidness\n \n: It is a sex-linked recessive disorder due to defect in\n\n\neither red or green cone of eye resulting in failure to discriminate between\n\n\nred and green colour.\n \nThis defect is due to mutation in certain genes\n\n\npresent in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and\n\n\nonly about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to\n\n\nred-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only\n\n\none X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries\nRationalised 2023-24","74\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nthe gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is\n\n\nnot herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its\n\n\neffect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter\n\n\nwill not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her\n\n\nfather is colour blind.\n\n\nHaemophilia\n \n: This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its\n\n\ntransmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny\n\n\nhas been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of\n\n\nthe cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to\n\n\nthis, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.\n\n\nThe heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease\n\n\nto sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely\n\n\nrare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the\n\n\nfather should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family\n\n\npedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents\n\n\nas she was a carrier of the disease.\n\n\nSickle-cell anaemia\n \n: This is an autosome linked recessive trait that\n\n\ncan be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners\n\n\nare carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a\n\n\nsingle pair of allele, Hb\nA\n \nand Hb\nS\n. Out of the three possible genotypes only\n\n\nhomozygous individuals for Hb\nS\n \n(Hb\nS\nHb\nS\n) show the diseased phenotype.\n\n\nHeterozygous (Hb\nA\nHb\nS\n) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they\n\n\nare carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission\n\n\nof the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait\n\n\n(Figure 4.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid\n\n\nFigure 4.15\n \nMicrograph of the red blood cells and the amino acid composition of the relevant\n\n\nportion of\n\n\nβ\n-chain of haemoglobin: (a) From a normal individual; (b) From an individual\n\n\nwith sickle-cell anaemia\nRationalised 2023-24","75\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n\n(Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the\n\n\nhaemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin\n\n\nprotein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of\n\n\nthe beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule\n\n\nundergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change\n\n\nin the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like\n\n\nstructure (Figure 4.15).\n\n\nPhenylketonuria\n \n: This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as\n\n\nthe autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme\n\n\nthat converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of\n\n\nthis phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid\n\n\nand other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental\n\n\nretardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor\n\n\nabsorption by kidney.\n\n\nThalassemia\n \n:\n \nThis is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease\n\n\ntransmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are\n\n\nunaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due\n\n\nto either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of\n\n\nsynthesis of one of the globin chains (\nα\n \nand\n \nβ\n \nchains) that make up\n\n\nhaemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin\n\n\nmolecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease.\n\n\nThalassemia can be classified according to which chain of the haemoglobin\n\n\nmolecule is affected. In\n \nα\n \nThalassemia, production of\n \nα\n \nglobin chain is\n\n\naffected while in\n \nβ\n \nThalassemia, production of\n \nβ\n \nglobin chain is affected.\n\n\nα\n \nThalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2\n\n\non chromosome 16 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or\n\n\ndeletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the\n\n\nless alpha globin molecules produced. While\n \nβ\n \nThalassemia is controlled\n\n\nby a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due\n\n\nto mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell\n\n\nanaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too\n\n\nfew globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of\n\n\nsynthesising an incorrectly functioning globin.\n\n\n4.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders\n\n\nThe chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence\n\n\nor excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes.\n\n\nFailure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results\n\n\nin the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called\n \naneuploidy\n. For example,\n\n\nDown’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\n\nSimilarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in\n\n\nhuman females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division\n\n\nresults in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and,\n\n\nthis phenomenon is known as\n \npolyploidy\n. This condition is often seen in\n\n\nplants.\n\n\nThe total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46\n\n\n(23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of\n\n\nchromosomes are sex chromosome. Sometimes, though rarely, either an\n\n\nadditional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an\nRationalised 2023-24","76\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFlat back of head\n\n\nMany “loops” on\n\n\nfinger tips\n\n\nPalm crease\n\n\nBroad flat face\n\n\nBig and wrinkled\n\n\ntongue\n\n\nCongenital heart\n\n\ndisease\n\n\nindividual\n \nmay\n \nlack\n \none\n \nof\n \nany\n \none\n \npair\n \nof\n\n\nchromosomes.

Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and\n\n\nphysiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists.\n\n\nMendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While\n\n\nstudying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting\n\n\ncharacters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are\n\n\ntoday referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that\n\n\nthe ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found\n\n\nin pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the\n\n\ncharacters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different–first\n\n\ngenerations (F\n1\n), second (F\n2\n) and so on. Some characters are dominant\n\n\nover others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are\n\n\nin heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters\n\n\nare only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never\n\n\nblend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not\n\n\nexpressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it\n\n\nbecomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of\n\n\ngametes (Law of Segregation).\n\n\nNot all characters show true dominance. Some characters show\n\n\nincomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the\n\n\ninheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors\n\n\nindependently\n \nassort\n \nand\n \ncombine\n \nin\n \nall\n \npermutations\n \nand\n\n\ncombinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations\n\n\nof gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known\n\n\nas ‘Punnett Square’.\n \nThe factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes\n\n\nregulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical\n\n\nexpression of the chraracters is called phenotype.\n\n\nAfter knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a\n\n\ngood correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and\n\n\nassortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were\n\n\nextended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it\n\n\nwas found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold\n\n\ntrue for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These\n\n\ngenes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted\n\n\ntogether, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted\n\n\nindependently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement\n\n\nof genes on a chromosome.\n\n\nMany genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked\n\n\ngenes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of\n\n\nchromosomes which were common, and another set which was\n\n\ndifferent. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were\n\n\nnamed\n \nas\n \nsex\n \nchromosomes.\n \nThe\n \nremaining\n \nset\n \nwas\n \nnamed\n \nas\n\n\nautosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes\n\n\nand a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes\n\n\nand a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in\n\n\nmale are ZZ, and in females are ZW.\n\n\nMutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point\n\n\nmutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is\n\n\ncaused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of\n\n\nhemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a\n\n\npedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of\nRationalised 2023-24","78\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nEXERCISES\n\n\n1.\n \nMention the advantages of selecting pea plant for experiment by Mendel.\n\n\n2.\n \nDifferentiate between the following –\n\n\n(a) Dominance and Recessive\n\n\n(b) Homozygous and Heterozygous\n\n\n(c) Monohybrid and Dihybrid.\n\n\n3.\n \nA diploid organism is heterozygous for 4 loci, how many types of gametes\n\n\ncan be produced?\n\n\n4.\n \nExplain the Law of Dominance using a monohybrid cross.\n\n\n5.\n \nDefine and design a test-cross.\n\n\n6.\n \nUsing a Punnett Square, workout the distribution of phenotypic features\n\n\nin the first filial generation after a cross between a homozygous female\n\n\nand a heterozygous male for a single locus.\n\n\n7.\n \nWhen a cross in made between tall plant with yellow seeds\n \n(TtYy) and\n\n\ntall plant with green seed (Ttyy), what proportions of phenotype in the\n\n\noffspring could be expected to be\n\n\n(a) tall and green.\n\n\n(b) dwarf and green.\n\n\n8.\n \nTwo heterozygous parents are crossed.

At the\n\n\ntime of Mendel, the nature of those ‘factors’ regulating\n\n\nthe pattern of inheritance was not clear. Over the next\n\n\nhundred years, the nature of the putative genetic material\n\n\nwas investigated culminating in the realisation that\n\n\nDNA – deoxyribonucleic acid – is the genetic material, at\n\n\nleast for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have\n\n\nlearnt that nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.\n\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid\n\n\n(RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living\n\n\nsystems. DNA acts as the genetic material in most of the\n\n\norganisms. RNA though it also acts as a genetic material\n\n\nin some viruses, mostly functions as a messenger. RNA\n\n\nhas additional roles as well. It functions as adapter,\n\n\nstructural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In\n\n\nClass XI you have already learnt the structures of\n\n\nnucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked\n\n\nto form nucleic acid polymers.

In the last section, the essentials of\n\n\nhuman genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed.\n\n\nLet us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of\n\n\nthe most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In\n\n\nsubsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant\n\n\ngenetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA.\n\n\n5.1 T\nHE\n \nDNA\n\n\nDNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides.\n \nThe length of DNA is\n\n\nusually defined as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred\n\n\nto as base pairs) present in it. This also is the characteristic of an organism.\n\n\nFor example, a bacteriophage known as\n \nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\n \n×174 has 5386 nucleotides,\n\n\nBacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp),\n \nEscherichia coli\n \nhas\n\n\n4.6 × 10\n6\n \nbp, and haploid content of human DNA is 3.3 × 10\n9\n \nbp. Let us\n\n\ndiscuss the structure of such a long polymer.\n\n\n5.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain\n\n\nLet us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA\n\n\nor RNA). A nucleotide has three components – a nitrogenous base, a\n\n\npentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a\n\n\nphosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases – Purines\n\n\n(Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine).\n\n\nCytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in\n\n\nDNA. Uracil is\n \npresent in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous\n\n\nbase is linked to the OH of 1\n'\n \nC pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic\n\n\nlinkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine,\n\n\nguanosine or deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or\n\n\ndeoxythymidine.\n \nWhen a phosphate group is linked to OH of 5\n'\n \nC\n \nof a\n\n\nnucleoside through phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide\n\n\n(or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed.\n\n\nTwo nucleotides are linked through 3\n'\n-5\n'\n \nphosphodiester linkage to form\n\n\na dinucleotide. More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form\n\n\na polynucleotide chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free\n\n\nFigure 5.1\n \nA Polynucleotide chain\nRationalised 2023-24","81\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nphosphate moiety at 5\n'\n \n-end of sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of\n\n\npolynucleotide chain. Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the sugar\n\n\nhas a free OH of 3\n'\n \nC\n \ngroup which is referred to as 3\n'\n \n- end of the\n\n\npolynucleotide chain. The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed\n\n\ndue to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar\n\n\nmoiety project from the backbone (Figure 5.1).\n\n\nIn RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional –OH group present\n\n\nat 2\n'\n \n-position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of\n\n\nthymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine).\n\n\nDNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by\n\n\nFriedrich Meischer in 1869. He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to\n\n\ntechnical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation\n\n\nof structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was\n\n\nonly in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray\n\n\ndiffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,\n\n\nproposed a very simple but famous\n \nDouble Helix\n \nmodel for the structure\n\n\nof DNA. One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between\n\n\nthe two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was\n\n\nalso based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded\n\n\nDNA, the ratios between\n \nAdenine\n \nand\n \nThymine\n \nand\n \nGuanine\n \nand\n \nCytosine\n\n\nare constant and equals one.\n\n\nThe base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide\n\n\nchains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if\n\n\nthe sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other\n\n\nstrand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a\n\n\nparental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two\n\n\ndouble stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced\n\n\nwould be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic\n\n\nimplications of the structure of DNA became very clear.\n\n\nThe salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows:\n\n\n(i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is\n\n\nconstituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.\n\n\n(ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one\n\n\nchain has the polarity 5\n'\n \nà\n3\n'\n \n, the other has 3\n'\n \nà\n5\n'\n \n.\n\n\n(iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond\n\n\n(H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen\n\n\nbonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.\n\n\nSimilarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.\n\n\nAs a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This\n\n\ngenerates approximately uniform distance between the two\n\n\nstrands of the helix (Figure 5.2).\n\n\n(iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch\n\n\nof the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a\n\n\nmetre, that is 10\n-9\n \nm) and there are roughly 10 bp in each\nRationalised 2023-24","82\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 5.2\n \nDouble stranded polynucleotide chain\n\n\nFigure 5.3\n \nDNA double helix\n\n\nturn. Consequently, the distance\n\n\nbetween\n \na\n \nbp\n \nin\n \na\n \nhelix\n \nis\n\n\napproximately 0.34 nm.\n\n\n(v) The plane of one base pair stacks\n\n\nover the other in double helix. This,\n\n\nin addition to H-bonds, confers\n\n\nstability of the helical structure\n\n\n(Figure 5.3).\n\n\nCompare the structure of purines and\n\n\npyrimidines. Can you find out why the\n\n\ndistance between two polynucleotide\n\n\nchains in DNA remains almost constant?\n\n\nThe\n \nproposition\n \nof\n \na\n \ndouble\n \nhelix\n\n\nstructure for DNA and its simplicity in\n\n\nexplaining the genetic implication became\n\n\nrevolutionary. Very soon, Francis Crick\n\n\nproposed the Central dogma in molecular\n\n\nbiology, which states that the genetic\n\n\ninformation flows from DNA\nà\nRNA\nà\nProtein.\n\n\nCentral dogma\nRationalised 2023-24","83\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nFigure 5.4a\n \nNucleosome\n\n\nFigure 5.4b\n \nEM picture - ‘Beads-on-String’\n\n\nIn some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction, that is,\n\n\nfrom RNA to DNA.\n \nCan you suggest a simple name to the process?\n\n\n5.1.2\n \nPackaging of DNA Helix\n\n\nTaken the distance between two consecutive base pairs\n\n\nas 0.34 nm (0.34×10\n–9\n \nm), if the length of DNA double\n\n\nhelix in a typical mammalian cell is calculated (simply\n\n\nby multiplying the total number of bp with distance\n\n\nbetween two consecutive bp, that is, 6.6 × 10\n9\n \nbp ×\n\n\n0.34 × 10\n-9\n \nm/bp), it comes out to be approximately\n\n\n2.2 metres. A length that is far greater than the\n\n\ndimension of a typical nucleus (approximately 10\n–6\n \nm).\n\n\nHow is such a long polymer packaged in a cell?\n\n\nIf the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm, can you\n\n\ncalculate the number of base pairs in E.coli?\n\n\nIn prokaryotes, such as,\n \nE. coli\n, though they do\n\n\nnot have a defined nucleus, the DNA is not scattered\n\n\nthroughout the cell. DNA (being negatively charged)\n\n\nis held with some proteins (that have positive\n\n\ncharges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid’. The DNA\n\n\nin nucleoid is organised in large loops held by\n\n\nproteins.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, this organisation is much more\n\n\ncomplex. There is a set of positively charged, basic\n\n\nproteins called\n \nhistones\n. A protein acquires charge\n\n\ndepending upon the abundance of amino acids\n\n\nresidues with charged side chains. Histones are rich\n\n\nin the basic amino acid residues lysine and arginine.\n\n\nBoth the amino acid residues carry positive charges\n\n\nin their side chains. Histones are organised to form\n\n\na unit of eight molecules called\n \nhistone octamer\n.\n\n\nThe negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged\n\n\nhistone octamer to form a structure called\n \nnucleosome\n \n(Figure 5.4 a). A\n\n\ntypical nucleosome contains 200 bp of DNA helix. Nucleosomes constitute\n\n\nthe repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called\n \nchromatin,\n \nthread-\n\n\nlike stained (coloured) bodies seen in nucleus. The nucleosomes in\n\n\nchromatin are seen as ‘beads-on-string’ structure when viewed under\n\n\nelectron microscope (EM) (Figure 5.4 b).\n\n\nTheoretically, how many such beads (nucleosomes) do you imagine\n\n\nare present in a mammalian cell?\n\n\nThe beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form\n\n\nchromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage\n\n\nof cell division to form chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at higher\n\n\nlevel requires additional set of proteins that collectively are referred to as\nRationalised 2023-24","84\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nNon-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins\n. In a typical nucleus, some\n\n\nregion of chromatin are loosely packed (and stains light) and are referred to\n\n\nas\n \neuchromatin\n. The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains\n\n\ndark are called as\n \nHeterochromatin\n.\n \nEuchromatin is said to be\n\n\ntranscriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive.\n\n\n5.2 T\nHE\n \nS\nEARCH\n \nFOR\n \nG\nENETIC\n \nM\nATERIAL\n\n\nEven though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition\n\n\nfor principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but\n\n\nthat the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and\n\n\nproven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic\n\n\ninheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by\n\n\nGregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other\n\n\nscientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the\n\n\nnucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the\n\n\ngenetic material, had not been answered.\n\n\nTransforming Principle\n\n\nIn 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with\n \nStreptococcus\n\n\npneumoniae\n \n(bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a\n\n\nmiraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his\n\n\nexperiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form.\n\n\nWhen\n \nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n \n(pneumococcus) bacteria are grown\n\n\non a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others\n\n\nproduce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a\n\n\nmucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with\n\n\nthe S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected\n\n\nwith the R strain do not develop pneumonia.\n\n\nGriffith was able to kill bacteria by heating them. He observed that\n\n\nheat-killed S strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. When he\nRationalised 2023-24","85\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\ninjected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died.\n\n\nMoreover, he recovered living S bacteria from the dead mice.\n\n\nHe concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been\n\n\ntransformed\n \nby the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming\n\n\nprinciple’, transferred from the heat-killed S strain, had enabled the\n\n\nR strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.\n\n\nThis must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the\n\n\nbiochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his\n\n\nexperiments.\n\n\nBiochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle\n\n\nPrior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty\n\n\n(1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked\n\n\nto determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's\n\n\nexperiment.\n\n\nThey purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the\n\n\nheat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into\n\n\nS cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria\n\n\nto become transformed.\n\n\nThey also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and\n\n\nRNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the\n\n\ntransforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase\n\n\ndid inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the\n\n\ntransformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but\n\n\nnot all biologists were convinced.\n\n\nCan you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase?\n\n\n5.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA\n\n\nThe unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the\n\n\nexperiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked\n\n\nwith viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.\n\n\nThe bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material\n\n\nthen enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic\n\n\nmaterial as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus\n\n\nparticles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein\n\n\nor DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria.\n\n\nThey grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive\n\n\nphosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur.\n\n\nViruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained\n\n\nradioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains\n\n\nphosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive\n\n\nsulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because\n\n\nDNA does not contain sulfur.\nRationalised 2023-24","86\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nRadioactive phages were allowed to attach to\n \nE. coli\n \nbacteria. Then, as\n\n\nthe infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by\n\n\nagitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the\n\n\nbacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.\n\n\nBacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA\n\n\nwere radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from\n\n\nthe virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had\n\n\nradioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did\n\n\nnot enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic\n\n\nmaterial that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 5.5).\n\n\nFigure 5.5\n \nThe Hershey-Chase experiment\n\n\n5.2.2 Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA)\n\n\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins\n\n\nversus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from\n\n\nHershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA\n\n\nthat acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that\nRationalised 2023-24","87\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nin some viruses, RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic\n\n\nviruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.). Answer to some of the questions such as,\n\n\nwhy DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs\n\n\ndynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the\n\n\ndifferences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules.\n\n\nCan you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA?\n\n\nA molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following\n\n\ncriteria:\n\n\n(i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).\n\n\n(ii) It should be stable chemically and structurally.\n\n\n(iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that\n\n\nare required for evolution.\n\n\n(iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian\n\n\nCharacters’.\n\n\nIf one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base\n\n\npairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have\n\n\nthe ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living\n\n\nsystem, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself.\n\n\nThe genetic material should be stable enough not to change with\n\n\ndifferent stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the\n\n\norganism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very\n\n\nevident in Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed\n\n\nthe bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic\n\n\nmaterial. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the\n\n\ntwo strands being complementary if separated by heating come together,\n\n\nwhen appropriate conditions are provided. Further, 2\n'\n-OH group present\n\n\nat every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and\n\n\neasily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive.\n\n\nTherefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable\n\n\nwhen compared to RNA. Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA\n\n\nis a better genetic material.\n\n\nIn fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers\n\n\nadditional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires\n\n\nunderstanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these\n\n\nprocesses in higher classes.)\n\n\nBoth DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable,\n\n\nmutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and\n\n\nhaving shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.\n\n\nRNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily\n\n\nexpress the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis\n\n\nof proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA.\n\n\nThe above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as\nRationalised 2023-24","88\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ngenetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of\n\n\ngenetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA\n\n\nis better.\n\n\n5.3 RNA W\nORLD\n\n\nFrom foregoing discussion, an immediate question becomes evident –\n\n\nwhich is the first genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the\n\n\nchapter on chemical evolution, but briefly, we shall highlight some of the\n\n\nfacts and points.\n\n\nRNA was the first genetic material. There is now enough evidence to\n\n\nsuggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation,\n\n\nsplicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as\n\n\na genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some\n\n\nimportant biochemical reactions in living systems that\n\n\nare catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein\n\n\nenzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and\n\n\nhence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA\n\n\nwith chemical modifications that make it more stable.\n\n\nDNA being double stranded and having complementary\n\n\nstrand further resists changes by evolving a process of\n\n\nrepair.\n\n\n5.4 R\nEPLICATION\n\n\nWhile proposing the double helical structure for DNA,\n\n\nWatson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme\n\n\nfor replication of DNA. To quote their original statement\n\n\nthat is as follows:\n\n\n‘‘It has not escaped our notice that the specific\n\n\npairing we have postulated immediately suggests a\n\n\npossible copying mechanism for the genetic material’’\n\n\n(Watson and Crick, 1953).\n\n\nThe scheme suggested that the two strands would\n\n\nseparate and act as a template for the synthesis of new\n\n\ncomplementary strands. After the completion of\n\n\nreplication, each DNA molecule would have one\n\n\nparental and one newly synthesised strand. This\n\n\nscheme was termed as\n \nsemiconservative\n \nDNA\n\n\nreplication (Figure 5.6).\n\n\n5.4.1 The Experimental Proof\n\n\nIt is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively. It was shown first in\n\n\nEscherichia coli\n \nand subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants\n\n\nFigure\n \n5.6\n \nWatson-Crick\n \nmodel\n \nfor\n\n\nse m i c o n s e r v a t i v e\n \nD N A\n\n\nreplication\nRationalised 2023-24","89\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nFigure 5.7\n \nMeselson and Stahl’s Experiment\n\n\nand human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the\n\n\nfollowing experiment in 1958:\n\n\n(i)\n \nThey grew\n \nE. coli\n \nin a medium containing\n \n15\nNH\n4\nCl (\n15\nN is the heavy\n\n\nisotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many\n\n\ngenerations. The result was that\n \n15\nN was incorporated into newly\n\n\nsynthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).\n\n\nThis heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal\n\n\nDNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient\n\n\n(Please note that\n \n15\nN is not a radioactive isotope, and it can be\n\n\nseparated from\n \n14\nN only based on densities).\n\n\n(ii)\n \nThen they transferred the cells into a medium with normal\n\n\n14\nNH\n4\nCl and took samples at various definite time intervals as\n\n\nthe cells multiplied, and extracted the DNA that remained as\n\n\ndouble-stranded helices. The various samples were separated\n\n\nindependently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of\n\n\nDNA (Figure 5.7).\n\n\nCan you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a\n\n\nmolecule with higher mass/density would sediment faster?\n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 5.7.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nThus, the DNA that was extracted from the culture one\n\n\ngeneration after the transfer from\n \n15\nN to\n \n14\nN medium [that is\n\n\nafter 20 minutes;\n \nE. coli\n \ndivides in 20 minutes] had a hybrid or\n\n\nintermediate density.\n \nDNA extracted from the culture after\n\n\nanother generation [that is after 40 minutes, II generation] was\nRationalised 2023-24","90\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ncomposed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of ‘light’\n\n\nDNA.\n\n\nIf E. coli was allowed to grow for 80 minutes then what would be the\n\n\nproportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule?\n\n\nVery similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to\n\n\ndetect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was\n\n\nperformed on\n \nVicia faba\n \n(faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958.\n\n\nThe experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate\n\n\nsemiconservatively.\n\n\n5.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes\n\n\nIn living cells, such as\n \nE. coli\n, the process of replication requires a set of\n\n\ncatalysts (enzymes). The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent\n\n\nDNA polymerase\n, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the\n\n\npolymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient\n\n\nenzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of\n\n\nnucleotides in a very short time.\n \nE. coli\n \nthat has only 4.6 × 10\n6\n \nbp (compare\n\n\nit with human whose diploid content is 6.6 × 10\n9\n \nbp), completes the\n\n\nprocess of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of\n\n\npolymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do\n\n\nthese polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction\n\n\nwith high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result\n\n\ninto mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive\n\n\nprocess. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In\n\n\naddition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation\n\n\nreaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates\n\n\nare high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP).\n\n\nIn addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional\n\n\nenzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high\n\n\ndegree of accuracy.\n \nFor long DNA molecules, since the two strands of\n\n\nDNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy\n\n\nrequirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA\n\n\nhelix, referred to as\n \nreplication fork\n. The DNA-dependent DNA\n\n\npolymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is 5\n'\n \nà\n3\n'\n.\n\n\nThis creates some additional complications at the replicating fork.\n\n\nConsequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 3\n'\n \nà\n5\n'\n \n), the\n\n\nreplication is\n \ncontinuous\n, while on the other (the template with\n\n\npolarity 5\n'\n \nà\n3\n'\n \n), it is\n \ndiscontinuous\n. The discontinuously synthesised\n\n\nfragments are later joined by the enzyme\n \nDNA ligase\n \n(Figure 5.8).\n\n\nThe DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of\n\n\nreplication. Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place\n\n\nin DNA. There is a definite region in\n \nE. coli\n \nDNA where the replication\n\n\noriginates. Such regions are termed as\n \norigin of replication\n. It is\nRationalised 2023-24","91\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nbecause of the requirement of\n \nthe origin of\n\n\nreplication that a piece of DNA if needed to be\n\n\npropagated during recombinant DNA procedures,\n\n\nrequires a vector. The vectors provide the origin of\n\n\nreplication.\n\n\nFurther, not every detail of replication is\n\n\nunderstood well.\n \nIn eukaryotes, the replication of\n\n\nDNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle.\n \nThe\n\n\nreplication of DNA and cell division cycle should be\n\n\nhighly coordinated. A failure in cell division after\n\n\nDNA\n \nreplication\n \nresults\n \ninto\n \npolyploidy(a\n\n\nchromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed\n\n\nnature of origin and the processes occurring at this\n\n\nsite, in higher classes.\n\n\n5.5 T\nRANSCRIPTION\n\n\nThe process of copying genetic information from one\n\n\nstrand\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nDNA\n \ninto\n \nRNA\n \nis\n \ntermed\n \nas\n\n\ntranscription\n.\n \nHere\n \nalso,\n \nthe\n \nprinciple\n \nof\n\n\ncomplementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine\n\n\ncomplements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However,\n\n\nunlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an\n\n\norganism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and\n\n\nonly one of the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the\n\n\nboundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that\n\n\nwould be transcribed.\n\n\nWhy both the strands are not copied during transcription has the\n\n\nsimple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code\n\n\nfor RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity\n\n\ndoes not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence\n\n\nof amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of\n\n\nthe DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would\n\n\ncomplicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two\n\n\nRNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to\n\n\neach other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent\n\n\nRNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription\n\n\nwould become a futile one.\n\n\n5.5.1 Transcription Unit\n\n\nA transcription unit in DNA is defined primarily by the three regions in\n\n\nthe DNA :\n\n\n(i) A Promoter\n\n\n(ii) The Structural gene\n\n\n(iii) A Terminator\n\n\nFigure 5.8\n \nReplicating Fork\nRationalised 2023-24","92\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThere is a convention in defining the two strands of the DNA in the\n\n\nstructural gene of a transcription unit. Since the two strands have opposite\n\n\npolarity and the\n \nDNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n \nalso catalyse the\n\n\npolymerisation in only one direction, that is, 5\n'\n \n→\n3\n'\n \n, the strand that has\n\n\nthe polarity 3\n'\n \n→\n5\n'\n \nacts as a template, and is also referred to as\n \ntemplate\n\n\nstrand\n. The other strand which has the polarity (5\n'\n \n→\n3\n'\n \n) and the sequence\n\n\nsame as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during\n\n\ntranscription. Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything)\n\n\nis referred to as\n \ncoding strand\n. All the reference point while defining a\n\n\ntranscription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a\n\n\nhypothetical sequence from a transcription unit is represented below:\n\n\n3\n'\n \n-ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC-5\n'\n \nTemplate Strand\n\n\n5\n'\n \n-TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-3\n'\n \nCoding Strand\n\n\nCan you now write the sequence of RNA transcribed from the above DNA?\n\n\nFigure 5.9\n \nSchematic structure of a transcription unit\n\n\nThe\n \npromoter\n \nand\n \nterminator\n \nflank the\n \nstructural gene\n \nin a\n\n\ntranscription unit.\n \nThe promoter is said to be located towards 5\n'\n \n-end\n\n\n(upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to\n\n\nthe polarity of coding strand). It is a DNA sequence that provides binding\n\n\nsite for RNA polymerase, and it is the presence of a promoter in a\n\n\ntranscription unit that also defines the template and coding strands. By\n\n\nswitching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template\n\n\nstrands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3\n'\n \n-end\n\n\n(downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the\n\n\nprocess of transcription (Figure 5.9). There are additional regulatory\n\n\nsequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the\n\n\npromoter. Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed\n\n\nwhile dealing with regulation of gene expression.\n\n\n5.5.2 Transcription Unit and the Gene\n\n\nA gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance. Though there is no\n\n\nambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally\nRationalised 2023-24","93\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\ndefine a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for\n\n\ntRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a\n \ncistron\n\n\nas a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a\n\n\ntranscription unit could be said as\n \nmonocistronic\n \n(mostly in eukaryotes)\n\n\nor\n \npolycistronic\n \n(mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the\n\n\nmonocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences – the\n\n\ngenes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed\n\n\nsequences are defined as\n \nexons\n. Exons are said to be those sequence\n\n\nthat appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by\n\n\nintrons\n.\n \nIntrons or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or\n\n\nprocessed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the\n\n\ndefinition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.\n\n\nInheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory\n\n\nsequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences\n\n\nare loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do\n\n\nnot code for any RNA or protein.\n\n\n5.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription\n\n\nIn bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA),\n\n\ntRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA).\n \nAll three RNAs are\n\n\nneeded to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template,\n\n\ntRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play\n\n\nstructural and catalytic role during translation. There is single\n\n\nDNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types\n\n\nof RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates\n\n\ntranscription (\nInitiation\n). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate\n\n\nFigure 5.10\n \nProcess of Transcription in Bacteria\nRationalised 2023-24","94\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nand polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of\n\n\ncomplementarity.\n \nIt somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and\n\n\ncontinues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the\n\n\nenzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent\n\n\nRNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in\n \ntermination\n \nof\n\n\ntranscription.\n\n\nAn intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able\n\n\nto catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and\n\n\ntermination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the\n\n\nprocess of elongation.\n \nIt associates transiently with\n \ninitiation-factor\n \n(\nσ\n)\n\n\nand\n \ntermination-factor\n \n(\nρ\n) to initiate and terminate the transcription,\n\n\nrespectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the\n\n\nRNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 5.10).\n\n\nIn bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become\n\n\nactive, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same\n\n\ncompartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria),\n\n\nmany times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully\n\n\ntranscribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled\n\n\nin bacteria.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities –\n\n\n(i)\n \nThere are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition\n\n\nto the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear\n\n\ncut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes\n \nrRNAs\n\n\nFigure 5.11\n \nProcess of Transcription in Eukaryotes\nRationalised 2023-24","95\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\n(28S, 18S, and 5.8S), whereas the RNA polymerase III is responsible\n\n\nfor transcription of\n \ntRNA\n,\n \n5srRNA\n, and\n \nsnRNAs\n \n(\nsmall nuclear\n\n\nRNAs\n). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the\n\n\nheterogeneous nuclear RNA\n \n(\nhnRNA\n).\n\n\n(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both\n\n\nthe exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is\n\n\nsubjected to a process called\n \nsplicing\n \nwhere the introns are removed\n\n\nand exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes\n\n\nadditional processing called as capping and tailing. In\n \ncapping\n \nan\n\n\nunusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to\n\n\nthe 5\n'\n-end of hnRNA. In\n \ntailing\n, adenylate residues (200-300) are\n\n\nadded at 3\n'\n-end in a template independent manner. It is the fully\n\n\nprocessed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the\n\n\nnucleus for translation (Figure 5.11).\n\n\nThe significance of such complexities is now beginning to be\n\n\nunderstood. The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient\n\n\nfeature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity,\n\n\nand the process of splicing represents the dominance of\n \nRNA-world\n. In\n\n\nrecent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes\n\n\nin the living system have assumed more importance.\n\n\n5.6\n \nG\nENETIC\n \nC\nODE\n\n\nDuring replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form\n\n\nanother nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise\n\n\non the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires\n\n\ntransfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to synthesise\n\n\na polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between\n\n\nnucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There\n\n\nexisted ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in\n\n\nnucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids\n\n\nin proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct\n\n\nthe sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins.\n\n\nIf determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the\n\n\nstructure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of\n\n\ngenetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required\n\n\ninvolvement of scientists from several disciplines – physicists, organic\n\n\nchemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist,\n\n\nwho argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for\n\n\n20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He\n\n\nsuggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should\n\n\nbe made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because\n\n\na permutation combination of 4\n3\n \n(4 × 4 × 4) would generate 64 codons;\n\n\ngenerating many more codons than required.\n\n\nProviding proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting\n\n\ntask. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was\nRationalised 2023-24","96\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ninstrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations\n\n\nof bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free\n\n\nsystem for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered.\n\n\nSevero Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful\n\n\nin polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent\n\n\nmanner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic\n\n\ncode was prepared which is given in Table 5.1.\n\n\nTable 5.1: The Codons for the Various Amino Acids\n\n\nThe salient features of genetic code are as follows:\n\n\n(i) The codon is triplet. 61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do\n\n\nnot code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.\n\n\n(ii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence\n\n\nthe code is\n \ndegenerate\n.\n\n\n(iii) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are\n\n\nno punctuations.\n\n\n(iv) The code is nearly\n \nuniversal\n: for example, from bacteria to human\n\n\nUUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this\n\n\nrule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some\n\n\nprotozoans.\n\n\n(v) AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met) , and it\n\n\nalso act as\n \ninitiator\n \ncodon.\n\n\n(vi) UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons.\n\n\nIf following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the\n\n\nsequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard):\n\n\n-AUG UUU UUC UUC UUU UUU UUC-\nRationalised 2023-24","97\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nNow try the opposite. Following is the sequence of amino acids coded\n\n\nby an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RNA:\n\n\nMet-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe\n\n\nDo you face any difficulty in predicting the opposite?\n\n\nCan you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have\n\n\nlearnt?\n\n\n5.6.1 Mutations and Genetic Code\n\n\nThe relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation\n\n\nstudies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 4. Effects\n\n\nof large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to\n\n\ncomprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The\n\n\neffect of point mutations will be explained here.\n \nA classical example of\n\n\npoint mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin\n\n\nchain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine.\n\n\nIt results into a diseased condition called as\n \nsickle cell\n \nanemia\n. Effect of\n\n\npoint mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be\n\n\nbetter understood by following simple example.\n\n\nConsider a statement that is made up of the following words each\n\n\nhaving three letters like genetic code.\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nRED\n \nCAP\n\n\nIf we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the\n\n\nstatement, it would read as follows:\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nBRE\n \nDCA\n \nP\n\n\nSimilarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it\n\n\nwould read,\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nBIR\n \nEDC\n \nAP\n\n\nNow we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nBIG\n \nRED\n \nCAP\n\n\nThe same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D,\n\n\none by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word.\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nEDC\n \nAP\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nDCA\n \nP\n\n\nRAM\n \nHAS\n \nCAP\n\n\nThe conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious. Insertion or\n\n\ndeletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of\n\n\ninsertion or deletion. However, such mutations are referred to as\nRationalised 2023-24","98\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nframeshift insertion\n \nor\n \ndeletion mutations\n. Insertion or deletion of\n\n\nthree or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence\n\n\none or multiple amino acids, and reading frame remains unaltered from\n\n\nthat point onwards.\n\n\n5.6.2 tRNA– the Adapter Molecule\n\n\nFrom the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis\n\n\nCrick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it\n\n\nto the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to\n\n\nread the code uniquely. He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule\n\n\nthat would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind\n\n\nto specific amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA),\n\n\nwas known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role\n\n\nas an adapter molecule was assigned much later.\n\n\ntRNA\n \nhas\n \nan\n\n\nanticodon\n \nloop\n\n\nthat\n \nhas\n \nbases\n\n\ncomplementary to\n\n\nthe code, and it also\n\n\nhas an\n \namino acid\n\n\nacceptor\n \nend\n \nto\n\n\nwhich it binds to\n\n\namino\n \nacids.\n\n\ntRNAs are specific\n\n\nfor each amino acid\n\n\n(Figure 5.12).\n \nFor\n\n\ninitiation, there is\n\n\nanother specific tRNA that is referred to as\n \ninitiator tRNA\n. There are no\n\n\ntRNAs for stop codons. In figure 5.12, the secondary structure of tRNA\n\n\nhas been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the\n\n\ntRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L.\n\n\n5.7\n \nT\nRANSLATION\n\n\nTranslation\n \nrefers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to\n\n\nform a polypeptide (Figure 5.13). The order and sequence of amino acids\n\n\nare defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are\n\n\njoined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond.\n \nFormation of a\n\n\npeptide bond requires energy. Therefore, in the first phase itself amino\n\n\nacids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate\n\n\ntRNA – a\n \nprocess\n \ncommonly\n \ncalled\n \nas\n \ncharging\n \nof\n \ntRNA\n \nor\n\n\naminoacylation of tRNA\n \nto be more specific. If two such charged tRNAs\n\n\nare brought close enough, the formation of peptide bond between them\n\n\nFigure 5.12\n \ntRNA - the adapter molecule\nRationalised 2023-24","99\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nwould be favoured energetically. The\n\n\npresence of a catalyst would enhance\n\n\nthe rate of peptide bond formation.\n\n\nThe cellular factory responsible for\n\n\nsynthesising proteins is the ribosome.\n\n\nThe ribosome consists of structural\n\n\nRNAs and about 80 different proteins.\n\n\nIn its inactive state, it exists as two\n\n\nsubunits; a large subunit and a small\n\n\nsubunit. When the small subunit\n\n\nencounters an mRNA, the process of\n\n\ntranslation of the mRNA to protein\n\n\nbegins. There are two sites in the large\n\n\nsubunit, for subsequent amino acids\n\n\nto bind to and thus, be close enough\n\n\nto each other for the formation of a\n\n\npeptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria\n\n\nis the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond.\n\n\nA translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is flanked\n\n\nby the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide.\n\n\nAn mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated\n\n\nand are referred as\n \nuntranslated regions\n \n(\nUTR\n). The UTRs are present\n\n\nat both 5\n'\n \n-end (before start codon) and at 3\n'\n \n-end (after stop codon). They\n\n\nare required for efficient translation process.\n\n\nFor initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG)\n\n\nthat is recognised only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the\n\n\nelongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes\n\n\ncomposed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the\n\n\nappropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with\n\n\nthe tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the\n\n\nmRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide\n\n\nsequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a\n \nrelease\n\n\nfactor\n \nbinds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the\n\n\ncomplete polypeptide from the ribosome.\n\n\n5.8\n \nR\nEGULATION\n \nOF\n \nG\nENE\n \nE\nXPRESSION\n\n\nRegulation\n \nof gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur\n\n\nat various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation\n\n\nof a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the\n\n\nregulation could be exerted at\n\n\n(i)\n \ntranscriptional level (formation of primary transcript),\n\n\n(ii)\n \nprocessing level (regulation of splicing),\n\n\n(iii)\n \ntransport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm,\n\n\n(iv)\n \ntranslational level.\n\n\nFigure 5.13\n \nTranslation\nRationalised 2023-24","100\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThe genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a\n\n\nset of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is\n\n\nsynthesised by\n \nE. coli\n, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a\n\n\ndisaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them\n\n\nas a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around\n\n\nthem to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the\n\n\nsynthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore, in simple terms,\n\n\nit is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate\n\n\nthe expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo\n\n\ninto adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of\n\n\nexpression of several sets of genes.\n\n\nIn prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the\n\n\npredominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit,\n\n\nthe activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated\n\n\nby interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise\n\n\nstart sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators)\n\n\nand negatively (repressors).\n \nThe accessibility of promoter regions of\n\n\nprokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins\n\n\nwith sequences termed\n \noperators\n. The operator region is adjacent to the\n\n\npromoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of\n\n\nthe operator bind a repressor protein.\n \nEach operon has its specific\n\n\noperator and specific repressor.\n \nFor example,\n \nlac\n \noperator is present\n\n\nonly in the\n \nlac\n \noperon and it interacts specifically with\n \nlac\n \nrepressor only.\n\n\n5.8.1 The\n \nLac\n \noperon\n\n\nThe elucidation of the\n \nlac\n \noperon was also a result of a close association\n\n\nbetween a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, Jacque Monod. They\n\n\nwere the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system. In\n \nlac\n \noperon\n\n\n(here\n \nlac\n \nrefers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a\n\n\ncommon promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common\n\n\nin bacteria and is referred to as\n \noperon\n. To name few such examples,\n \nlac\n\n\noperon,\n \ntrp\n \noperon,\n \nara\n \noperon,\n \nhis\n \noperon,\n \nval\n \noperon, etc.\n\n\nThe\n \nlac\n \noperon consists of one regulatory gene (the\n \ni\n \ngene – here the\n\n\nterm\n \ni\n \ndoes not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor)\n\n\nand three structural genes (\nz\n,\n \ny\n, and\n \na\n). The\n \ni\n \ngene codes for the repressor\n\n\nof the\n \nlac\n \noperon. The\n \nz\n \ngene codes for beta-galactosidase (\n\n\nβ\n-gal), which\n\n\nis primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose\n\n\ninto its monomeric units, galactose and glucose. The\n \ny\n \ngene codes for\n\n\npermease, which increases permeability of the cell to\n\n\nβ\n-galactosides. The\n\n\na\n \ngene encodes a transacetylase. Hence, all the three gene products in\n\n\nlac\n \noperon are required for metabolism of lactose. In most other operons\n\n\nas well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function\n\n\nin the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 5.14).\nRationalised 2023-24","101\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nLactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it\n\n\nregulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as\n \ninducer\n.\n\n\nIn the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is\n\n\nprovided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported\n\n\ninto the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level\n\n\nof expression of\n \nlac\n \noperon has to be present in the cell all the time,\n\n\notherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the\n\n\noperon in the following manner.\n\n\nThe repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time – constitutively)\n\n\nfrom the\n \ni\n \ngene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the\n\n\noperon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In\n\n\nthe presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is\n\n\ninactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase\n\n\naccess to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 5.14).\n\n\nEssentially, regulation of\n \nlac\n \noperon can also be visualised as regulation\n\n\nof enzyme synthesis by its substrate.\n\n\nRemember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac\n\n\noperon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed\n\n\nin the presence of lactose?\n\n\nRegulation of\n \nlac\n \noperon by repressor is referred to as\n \nnegative\n\n\nregulation\n.\n \nLac\n \noperon is under control of positive regulation as well,\n\n\nbut it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level.\n\n\nFigure 5.14\n \nThe\n \nlac\n \nOperon\nRationalised 2023-24","102\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\n5.9 H\nUMAN\n \nG\nENOME\n \nP\nROJECT\n\n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in\n\n\nDNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other\n\n\nwords, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA\n\n\nsequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also\n\n\nbe different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of\n\n\nfinding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the\n\n\nestablishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to\n\n\nisolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast\n\n\ntechniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of\n\n\nsequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990.\n\n\nHuman Genome Project\n \n(HGP) was called a mega project. You can\n\n\nimagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply\n\n\ndefine the aims of the project as follows:\n\n\nHuman genome is said to have approximately 3 x 10\n9\n \nbp, and if the\n\n\ncost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the\n\n\nbeginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately\n\n\n9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored\n\n\nin typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000\n\n\nletters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would\n\n\nbe required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human\n\n\ncell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also\n\n\nnecessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage\n\n\nand retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid\n\n\ndevelopment of a new area in biology called\n \nBioinformatics.\n\n\nGoals of HGP\n\n\nSome of the important goals of HGP were as follows:\n\n\n(i)\n \nIdentify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA;\n\n\n(ii)\n \nDetermine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that\n\n\nmake up human DNA;\n\n\n(iiii)\n \nStore this information in databases;\n\n\n(iv)\n \nImprove tools for data analysis;\n\n\n(v)\n \nTransfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries;\n\n\n(vi)\n \nAddress the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise\n\n\nfrom the project.\n\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by\n\n\nthe U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During\n\n\nthe early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major\n\n\npartner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany,\n\n\nChina and others. The project was completed in 2003. Knowledge about\n\n\nthe effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary\n\n\nnew ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of\nRationalised 2023-24","103\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\ndisorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to\n\n\nunderstanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms\n\n\nDNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities\n\n\nthat can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture,\n\n\nenergy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model\n\n\norganisms, such as bacteria, yeast,\n \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n \n(a free living\n\n\nnon-pathogenic nematode),\n \nDrosophila\n \n(the fruit fly), plants (rice and\n\n\nArabidopsis\n), etc., have also been sequenced.\n\n\nMethodologies :\n \nThe methods involved two major approaches. One\n\n\napproach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as\n\n\nRNA (referred to as\n \nExpressed Sequence Tags\n \n(ESTs). The other took\n\n\nthe blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that\n\n\ncontained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning\n\n\ndifferent regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as\n\n\nSequence Annotation\n). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is\n\n\nisolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes\n\n\n(recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in\n\n\nsequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using\n\n\nspecialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece\n\n\nof DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease.\n\n\nThe commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were\n\n\ncalled as\n \nBAC\n \n(bacterial artificial chromosomes), and\n \nYAC\n \n(yeast artificial\n\n\nchromosomes).\n\n\nThe fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that\n\n\nworked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger.\n\n\n(Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for\n\n\ndetermination\n \nof\n \namino\n \nacid\n\n\nsequences\n \nin\n \nproteins).\n \nThese\n\n\nsequences were then arranged based\n\n\non\n \nsome\n \noverlapping\n \nregions\n\n\npresent in them.\n \nThis required\n\n\ngeneration of overlapping fragments\n\n\nfor sequencing. Alignment of these\n\n\nsequences\n \nwas\n \nhumanly\n \nnot\n\n\npossible. Therefore, specialised\n\n\ncomputer based programs were\n\n\ndeveloped (Figure 5.15). These\n\n\nsequences\n \nwere\n \nsubsequently\n\n\nannotated and were assigned to each\n\n\nchromosome.\n \nThe\n \nsequence\n \nof\n\n\nchromosome 1 was completed only\n\n\nin May 2006 (this was the last of the\n\n\n24\n \nhuman\n \nchromosomes\n \n–\n \n22\n\n\nautosomes and X and Y – to be\n\n\n103\n\n\nFigure 5.15\n \nA representative diagram of human\n\n\ngenome project\nRationalised 2023-24","104\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nsequenced).\n \nAnother challenging task was assigning the genetic and\n\n\nphysical maps on the genome. This was generated using information on\n\n\npolymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some\n\n\nrepetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications\n\n\nof polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next\n\n\nsection of DNA fingerprinting).\n\n\n5.9.1 Salient Features of Human Genome\n\n\nSome of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are\n\n\nas follows:\n\n\n(i)\n \nThe human genome contains 3164.7 million bp.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nThe average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with\n\n\nthe largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nThe total number of genes is estimated at 30,000– much lower\n\n\nthan previous estimates of 80,000 to 1,40,000 genes. Almost all\n\n\n(99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nThe functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered\n\n\ngenes.\n\n\n(v)\n \nLess than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins.\n\n\n(vi)\n \nRepeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome.\n\n\n(vii)\n \nRepetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are\n\n\nrepeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times. They\n\n\nare thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light\n\n\non chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution.\n\n\n(viii)\n \nChromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (231).\n\n\n(ix)\n \nScientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single-\n\n\nbase DNA differences (\nSNPs\n \n–\n \nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\n,\n\n\npronounced as ‘snips’) occur in humans. This information promises\n\n\nto revolutionise the processes of finding chromosomal locations for\n\n\ndisease-associated sequences and tracing human history.\n\n\n5.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges\n\n\nDeriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will define\n\n\nresearch through the coming decades leading to our understanding of\n\n\nbiological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and\n\n\ncreativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both\n\n\nthe public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of\n\n\nhaving the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach\n\n\nto biological research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes\n\n\nat a time. With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput\n\n\ntechnologies, we can approach questions systematically and on a much\nRationalised 2023-24","105\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nbroader scale. They can study all the genes in a genome, for example, all\n\n\nthe transcripts in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of\n\n\nthousands of genes and proteins work together in interconnected networks\n\n\nto orchestrate the chemistry of life.\n\n\n5.10 DNA F\nINGERPRINTING\n\n\nAs stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among\n\n\nhumans is the same.\n \nAssuming human genome as 3 × 10\n9\n \nbp\n,\n \nin how\n\n\nmany base sequences would there be differences?\n \nIt is these differences\n\n\nin sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their\n\n\nphenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences\n\n\nbetween two individuals or among individuals of a population,\n\n\nsequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive\n\n\ntask. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 × 10\n6\n\n\nbase pairs. DNA\n\n\nfingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any\n\n\ntwo individuals.\n\n\nDNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific\n\n\nregions in DNA sequence called as\n \nrepetitive DNA\n,\n \nbecause in these\n\n\nsequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive\n\n\nDNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during\n\n\ndensity gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and\n\n\nthe other small peaks are referred to as\n \nsatellite DNA\n. Depending on\n\n\nbase composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number\n\n\nof repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories,\n\n\nsuch as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally\n\n\ndo not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human\n\n\ngenome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form\n\n\nthe basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as\n\n\nblood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual\n\n\nshow the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful\n\n\nidentification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms\n\n\nare inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis\n\n\nof paternity testing, in case of disputes.\n\n\nAs polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping\n\n\nof human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we\n\n\nunderstand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms.\n\n\nPolymorphism\n \n(variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall\n\n\ndifferent kind of mutations and their effects that you have already\n\n\nstudied in Chapter 4, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.)\n\n\nNew mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in\n\n\nthe germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing\n\n\norganisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s\n\n\nability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to\nRationalised 2023-24","106\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nthe other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic\n\n\n(again recall the definition of alleles from Chapter 4) sequence variation\n\n\nhas traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than\n\n\none variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a\n\n\nfrequency greater than 0.01. In simple terms, if an\n \ninheritable mutation\n\n\nis observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as\n \nDNA\n\n\npolymorphism\n. The probability of such variation to be observed in non-\n\n\ncoding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences\n\n\nmay not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual’s\n\n\nreproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation\n\n\nafter generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism.\n\n\nThere is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single\n\n\nnucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and\n\n\nspeciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will\n\n\nstudy these in details at higher classes.\n\n\nThe technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec\n\n\nJeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree\n\n\nof polymorphism. It was called as\n \nVariable Number of Tandem\n \nRepeats\n\n\n(VNTR).\n \nThe technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot\n\n\nhybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included\n\n\n(i) isolation of DNA,\n\n\n(ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases,\n\n\n(iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis,\n\n\n(iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic\n\n\nmembranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon,\n\n\n(v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and\n\n\n(vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic\n\n\nrepresentation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 5.16.\n\n\nThe VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite.\n\n\nA small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The\n\n\ncopy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual.\n\n\nThe numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a\n\n\nresult the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to 20 kb. Consequently,\n\n\nafter hybridisation with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands\n\n\nof differing sizes. These bands give a characteristic pattern for an individual\n\n\nDNA (Figure 5.16). It differs from individual to individual in a population\n\n\nexcept in the case of monozygotic (identical) twins. The sensitivity of the\n\n\ntechnique has been increased by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR–\n\n\nyou will study about it in Chapter 9). Consequently, DNA from a single\n\n\ncell is enough to perform DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to\n\n\napplication in forensic science, it has much wider application, such as\nRationalised 2023-24","107\n\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n\nFigure 5.16\n \nSchematic representation of DNA fingerprinting : Few representative chromosomes\n\n\nhave been shown to contain different copy number of VNTR.\n \nFor the sake of\n\n\nunderstanding different colour schemes have been used to trace the origin of each\n\n\nband in the gel.\n \nThe two alleles (paternal and maternal) of a chromosome also\n\n\ncontain different copy numbers of VNTR.\n \nIt is clear that the banding pattern of DNA\n\n\nfrom crime scene matches with individual B, and not with A.\n\n\nin determining population and genetic diversities.

While DNA stores genetic\n\n\ninformation, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information.\n\n\nThough DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being\n\n\nchemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material.\n\n\nHowever, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA.\n \nThe\n\n\nhallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen\n\n\nbonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that\n\n\nAdenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with\n\n\nCytosine\n \nthrough\n \nthree\n \nH-bonds.\n \nThis\n \nmakes\n \none\n \nstrand\n\n\ncomplementary to the other.\n \nThe DNA replicates semiconservatively,\n\n\nthe process is guided by the complementary H-bonding.\n \nA segment of\n\n\nDNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as\n\n\ngene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a\n\n\ntemplate to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA.\n \nIn bacteria,\n\n\nthe transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, the gene is split.\n \nThe coding sequences, exons, are\n\n\ninterrupted by non-coding sequences, introns.\n \nIntrons are removed\n\n\nand exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The\n\n\nmessenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a\n\n\ncombination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino\n\n\nacid.\n \nThe genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity\n\n\nby tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule.\n \nThere are specific tRNAs for\n\n\nevery amino acid.\n \nThe tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end\n\n\nand pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its\n\n\nanticodons.\n \nThe site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes,\n\n\nwhich bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids.\n\n\nOne of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is\n\n\nan example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that\n\n\nhas evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since,\n\n\ntranscription\n \nand\n \ntranslation\n \nare\n \nenergetically\n \nvery\n \nexpensive\n\n\nprocesses, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription\n\n\nis the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more\n\n\nthan one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as\n\n\noperons.\n \nLac\n \noperon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes\n\n\nfor genes responsible for metabolism of lactose.\n \nThe operon is regulated\n\n\nby the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown.\n\n\nTherefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme\n\n\nsynthesis by its substrate.\n\n\nHuman genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence\n\n\nevery base in human genome. This project has yielded much new\n\n\ninformation. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a\n\n\nconsequence of the project.

Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the\n\n\nuniverse. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering\n\n\nthe size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The\n \nBig Bang\n \ntheory attempts\n\n\nto explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion\n\n\nunimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the\n\n\ntemperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.\n\n\nThe gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the\n\n\npresent day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth\n\n\nwas supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There\n\n\nwas no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane, carbondioxide\n\n\nand ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays\n\n\nfrom the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H\n2\n\n\nescaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water,\n\n\nCO\n2\n \nand others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor\n\n\nfell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500\n\n\nmillion years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back.\n\n\nDid life come from outerspace? Some scientists believe that it came\n\n\nfrom outside. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called\n \nspores\n\n\nwere transferred to different planets including earth. ‘Panspermia’ is still\n\n\na favourite idea for some astronomers. For a long time it was also believed\n\n\nthat life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc.\n\n\nThis was the theory of spontaneous generation. Louis Pasteur by careful\n\n\nexperimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.\n\n\nHe showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast\n\n\nwhile in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed\n\n\nyeast’. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all.\n\n\nHowever, this did not answer how the first life form came on earth.\n\n\nOparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form\n\n\nof life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules\n\n\n(e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical\n\n\nevolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic\n\n\nconstituents. The conditions on earth were – high temperature, volcanic\n\n\nstorms, reducing atmosphere containing CH\n4\n, NH\n3\n, etc. In 1953, S.L. Miller,\n\n\nan American scientist created similar conditions in a laboratory scale\n\n\n(Figure 6.1). He created electric discharge in a closed flask containing\n\n\nCH\n4\n, H\n2\n, NH\n3\n \nand water vapour at 800\n0\nC. He observed formation of amino\n\n\nacids. In similar experiments others observed, formation of sugars,\n\n\nnitrogen bases, pigment and fats. Analysis of meteorite content also\n\n\nrevealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are\n\n\noccurring elsewhere in space. With this limited evidence, the first part of\n\n\nthe conjectured story, i.e., chemical evolution was more or less accepted.\n\n\nWe have no idea about how the first self replicating metabolic capsule\n\n\nof life arose. The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated\n\n\n3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein,\nRationalised 2023-24","112\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nPolysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.\n\n\nThe first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000\n\n\nmillion years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in\n\n\nwater environment only. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of\n\n\nlife arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is\n\n\naccepted by majority. However, once formed, how the first cellular forms\n\n\nof life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the\n\n\nfascinating story that will be discussed below.\n\n\n6.2 E\nVOLUTION\n \nOF\n \nL\nIFE\n \nF\nORMS\n \n– A T\nHEORY\n\n\nConventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special\n\n\ncreation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms\n\n\n(species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the\n\n\ndiversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future\n\n\nalso. Three, that earth is about 4000 years old. All these ideas were\n\n\nstrongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on observations\n\n\nmade during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the\n\n\nworld, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share\n\n\nsimilarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with\n\n\nlife forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not\n\n\nexist any more. There had been extinctions of different life forms in the\n\n\nyears gone by just as new forms of life arose at different periods of history\n\n\nof earth. There has been gradual evolution of life forms. Any population\n\n\nFigure 6.1\n \nDiagrammatic representation of Miller’s\n\n\nexperiment\nRationalised 2023-24","113\n\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n\nhas built in variation in characteristics. Those characteristics which enable\n\n\nsome to survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors,\n\n\netc.) would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under such\n\n\nnatural conditions. Another word used is fitness of the individual or\n\n\npopulation. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only\n\n\nto reproductive fitness. Hence, those who are better fit in an environment,\n\n\nleave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and\n\n\nhence are selected by nature. He called it natural selection and implied it\n\n\nas a mechanism of evolution. Let us also remember that Alfred Wallace, a\n\n\nnaturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar\n\n\nconclusions around the same time. In due course of time, apparently new\n\n\ntypes of organisms are recognisable. All the existing life forms share\n\n\nsimilarities and share common ancestors. However, these ancestors were\n\n\npresent at different periods in the history of earth (epochs, periods and\n\n\neras). The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological\n\n\nhistory of earth. A common permissible conclusion is that earth is very\n\n\nold, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.\n\n\n6.3 W\nHAT\n \nARE\n \nTHE\n \nE\nVIDENCES\n \nFOR\n \nE\nVOLUTION\n?\n\n\nEvidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has\n\n\ncome from many quarters. Fossils are remains of hard parts of\n\n\nlife-forms found in rocks. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of\n\n\nearth's crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other\n\n\nduring the long history of earth. Different-aged rock sediments contain\n\n\nfossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of\n\n\nthe particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern\n\n\norganisms (Figure 6.2). They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).\n\n\nA study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological\n\n\nperiod in which they existed.\n \nThe study showed that life-forms varied\n\n\nover time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-\n\n\nspans. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history\n\n\nof earth. All this is called paleontological evidence.\n \nDo you remember how\n\n\nthe ages of the fossils are calculated? Do you recollect the method of\n\n\nradioactive-dating and the principles behind the procedure?\n\n\nEmbryological support for evolution\n \nwas also proposed by Ernst\n\n\nHeckel based upon the observation of certain features during embryonic\n\n\nstage common to all vertebrates that are absent in adult. For example,\n\n\nthe embryos of all vertebrates including human develop a row of vestigial\n\n\ngill slit just behind the head but it is a functional organ only in fish and\n\n\nnot found in any other adult vertebrates. However, this proposal was\n\n\ndisapproved on careful study performed by Karl Ernst von Baer. He noted\n\n\nthat embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals.\n\n\nComparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and\n\n\ndifferences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago.\nRationalised 2023-24","114\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 6.2\n \nA family tree of dinosaurs and their living modern day counterpart organisms like\n\n\ncrocodiles and birds\n\n\nSuch similarities can be interpreted to understand whether common\n\n\nancestors were shared or not. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and\n\n\nhuman (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs\n\n\n(Figure 6.3b). Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these\n\n\nanimals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have\n\n\nhumerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their\n\n\nforelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along\n\n\ndifferent directions due to adaptations to different needs. This is\n \ndivergent\n\n\nevolution\n \nand these structures are\n \nhomologous\n.\n \nHomology indicates\n\n\ncommon ancestry.\n \nOther examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In\nRationalised 2023-24","115\n\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n\nplants also, the thorn and tendrils of\n\n\nBougainvillea\n \nand\n \nCucurbita\n \nrepresent\n\n\nhomology (Figure 6.3a). Homology is\n\n\nbased on divergent evolution whereas\n\n\nanalogy refers to a situation exactly\n\n\nopposite. Wings of butterfly and of birds\n\n\nlook alike. They are not anatomically\n\n\nsimilar structures though they perform\n\n\nsimilar functions.\n \nHence, analogous\n\n\nstructures are a result of\n \nconvergent\n\n\nevolution\n \n- different structures evolving\n\n\nfor the same function and hence having\n\n\nsimilarity. Other examples of analogy are\n\n\nthe eye of the octopus and of mammals\n\n\nor the flippers of Penguins and Dolphins.\n\n\nOne can say that it is the similar habitat\n\n\nthat has resulted in selection of similar\n\n\nadaptive features in different groups of\n\n\norganisms but toward the same function:\n\n\nSweet potato (root modification) and\n\n\npotato (stem modification) is another\n\n\nexample for analogy.\n\n\nIn\n \nthe\n \nsame\n \nline\n \nof\n \nargument,\n\n\nsimilarities\n \nin\n \nproteins\n \nand\n \ngenes\n\n\nperforming a given function among diverse\n\n\norganisms give clues to common ancestry.\n\n\nThese biochemical similarities point to the\n\n\nsame shared ancestry as structural\n\n\nsimilarities among diverse organisms.\n\n\nMan has bred selected plants and\n\n\nanimals for agriculture, horticulture, sport\n\n\nor security. Man has domesticated many\n\n\nwild animals and crops. This intensive\n\n\nbreeding programme has created breeds\n\n\nthat differ from other breeds (e.g., dogs) but\n\n\nstill are of the same group. It is argued that\n\n\nif within hundreds of years, man could create new breeds, could not nature\n\n\nhave done the same over millions of years?\n\n\nAnother interesting observation supporting evolution by natural\n\n\nselection comes from England. In a collection of moths made in 1850s,\n\n\ni.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed that there were more\n\n\nwhite-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or melanised moths.\n\n\nHowever, in the collection carried out from the same area, but after\n\n\nindustrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in\n\n\nthe same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 6.3\n \nExample\n \nof\n \nhomologous\n \norgans\n \nin\n\n\n(a) Plants and (b) Animals\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nTendril\nRationalised 2023-24","116\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThe explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will\n\n\nspot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post-\n\n\nindustrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial\n\n\nsmoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not\n\n\nsurvive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before\n\n\nindustrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen\n\n\ncovered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived\n\n\nbut the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators.\n \nDo you know\n\n\nthat lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators?\n \nThey will\n\n\nnot grow in areas that are polluted.\n \nHence, moths that were able to\n\n\ncamouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived\n\n\n(Figure 6.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas\n\n\nwhere industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of\n\n\nmelanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those\n\n\nthat can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember\n\n\nthat no variant is completely wiped out.\n\n\nSimilarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted in\n\n\nselection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also true for\n\n\nmicrobes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic\n\n\norganisms/cell. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing in a time\n\n\nscale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples of evolution\n\n\nby anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not a directed\n\n\nprocess in the sense of determinism.\n \nIt is a stochastic process based on\n\n\nchance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.\n\n\n6.4 W\nHAT\n \nIS\n \nA\nDAPTIVE\n \nR\nADIATION\n?\n\n\nDuring his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands. There he observed\n\n\nan amazing diversity of creatures. Of particular interest, small black birds\n\n\nlater called Darwin’s Finches amazed him. He realised that there were many\n\n\nFigure 6.4\n \nFigure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised)\n\n\non a tree trunk (a) In unpolluted area (b) In polluted area\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\nRationalised 2023-24","117\n\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n\nvarieties of finches in the same island. All the varieties, he conjectured,\n\n\nevolved on the island itself. From the original seed-eating features, many\n\n\nother forms with altered beaks arose, enabling them to become insectivorous\n\n\nand vegetarian finches (Figure 6.5). This process of evolution of different\n\n\nspecies in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally\n\n\nradiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called\n \nadaptive radiation\n.\n\n\nDarwin’s finches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.\n\n\nAnother example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each\n\n\ndifferent from the other (Figure 6.6) evolved from an ancestral stock, but all\n\n\nwithin the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive radiation\n\n\nappeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing\n\n\nFigure 6.6\n \nAdaptive radiation of marsupials of Australia\n\n\nFigure 6.5\n \nVariety of beaks of finches that Darwin found in Galapagos Island\nRationalised 2023-24","118\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ndifferent habitats), one can call this convergent\n\n\nevolution. Placental mammals in Australia also\n\n\nexhibit adaptive radiation in evolving into\n\n\nvarieties of such placental mammals each of\n\n\nwhich appears to be ‘similar’ to a corresponding\n\n\nmarsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian\n\n\nwolf-marsupial). (Figure 6.7).\n\n\n6.5 B\nIOLOGICAL\n \nE\nVOLUTION\n\n\nEvolution by natural selection, in a true sense\n\n\nwould have started when cellular forms of life\n\n\nwith differences in metabolic capability\n\n\noriginated on earth.\n\n\nThe essence of Darwinian theory about\n\n\nevolution is natural selection. The rate of\n\n\nappearance of new forms is linked to the life cycle\n\n\nor the life span. Microbes that divide fast have\n\n\nthe ability to multiply and become millions of\n\n\nindividuals within hours. A colony of bacteria\n\n\n(say A) growing on a given medium has built-in\n\n\nvariation in terms of ability to utilise a feed\n\n\ncomponent.\n \nA\n \nchange\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nmedium\n\n\ncomposition would bring out only that part of\n\n\nthe population (say B) that can survive under\n\n\nthe new conditions. In due course of time this\n\n\nvariant population outgrows the others and\n\n\nappears as new species. This would happen\n\n\nwithin days. For the same thing to happen in a\n\n\nfish or fowl would take million of years as life\n\n\nspans of these animals are in years. Here we say\n\n\nthat fitness of B is better than that of A under\n\n\nthe new conditions. Nature selects for fitness.\n\n\nOne must remember that the so-called fitness is\n\n\nbased on characteristics which are inherited.\n\n\nHence, there must be a genetic basis for getting selected and to evolve.\n\n\nAnother way of saying the same thing is that some organisms are better\n\n\nadapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Adaptive ability is\n\n\ninherited. It has a genetic basis. Fitness is the end result of the ability to\n\n\nadapt and get selected by nature.\n\n\nBranching descent\n \nand\n \nnatural selection\n \nare the two key concepts\n\n\nof Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 6.7 and 6.8).\n\n\nEven before Darwin, a French naturalist Lamarck had said that\n\n\nevolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of\n\n\nFigure 6.7\n \nPicture showing convergent evolution\n\n\nof\n \nAustralian\n \nMarsupials\n \nand\n\n\nplacental mammals\nRationalised 2023-24","119\n\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n\norgans. He gave the examples of Giraffes who in an attempt to forage\n\n\nleaves on tall trees had to adapt by elongation of their necks. As they\n\n\npassed on this acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding\n\n\ngenerations, Giraffes, slowly, over the years, came to acquire long necks.\n\n\nNobody believes this conjecture any more.\n\n\nIs evolution a process or the result of a process? The world we see,\n\n\ninanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution. When we\n\n\ndescribe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process. On the\n\n\nother hand when we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution\n\n\nas a consequence of a process called natural selection. We are still not\n\n\nvery clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes\n\n\nor end result of unknown processes.\n\n\nIt is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations\n\n\ninfluenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations\n\n\nwhich are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations\n\n\nare stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation, members of a population\n\n\nvary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though\n\n\nthey look superficially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The\n\n\nfact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody\n\n\nreproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial\n\n\npopulation) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means\n\n\nthat there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and\n\n\ngrew at the cost of others that could not flourish. The novelty and brilliant\n\n\ninsight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable\n\n\nand which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat\n\n\nbetter) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence\n\n\nfor a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more\n\n\nprogeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and\n\n\nhence new forms appear to arise.\n\n\n6.6 M\nECHANISM\n \nOF\n \nE\nVOLUTION\n\n\nWhat is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even\n\n\nthough Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype,\n\n\nDarwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the first decade\n\n\nof twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose\n\n\nbrought forth the idea of mutations – large difference arising suddenly in\n\n\na population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and\n\n\nnot the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations\n\n\nare random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and\n\n\ndirectional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed\n\n\nmutation caused speciation and hence called it\n \nsaltation\n \n(single step\n\n\nlarge mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out\n\n\nsome clarity.\nRationalised 2023-24","120\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 6.8\n \nDiagrammatic representation of the operation of natural selection on different\n\n\ntraits : (a) Stabilising (b) Directional and (c) Disruptive\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n6.7 H\nARDY\n-W\nEINBERG\n \nP\nRINCIPLE\n\n\nIn a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of\n\n\nalleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed\n\n\nand even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle\n\n\nstated it using algebraic equations.\n\n\nThis principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable\n\n\nand is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes\n\n\nand their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called\n\n\ngenetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual\nRationalised 2023-24","121\n\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n\nfrequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q\n\n\nrepresent the frequency of allele\n \nA\n \nand allele\n \na\n \n. The frequency of\n \nAA\n\n\nindividuals in a population is simply p\n2\n. This is simply stated in another\n\n\nways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on\n\n\nboth the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product\n\n\nof the probabilities, i.e., p\n2\n. Similarly of aa is q\n2\n, of Aa 2pq. Hence,\n\n\np\n2\n+2pq+q\n2\n=1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q)\n2\n. When frequency\n\n\nmeasured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates\n\n\nthe extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or\n\n\nHardy- Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a\n\n\npopulation would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution.\n\n\nFive factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These\n\n\nare gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic\n\n\nrecombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of\n\n\npopulation to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies\n\n\nchange in the original as well as in the new population. New genes/alleles\n\n\nare added to the new population and these are lost from the old population.\n\n\nThere would be a gene flow if this gene migration, happens multiple times.\n\n\nIf the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes\n\n\nthe change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population\n\n\nthat they become a different species. The original drifted population\n\n\nbecomes founders and the effect is called\n \nfounder effect\n.\n\n\nMicrobial experiments show that pre-existing advantageous\n\n\nmutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes.\n\n\nOver few generations, this would result in Speciation. Natural selection is\n\n\na process in which heritable variations enabling better survival are enabled\n\n\nto reproduce and leave greater number of progeny. A critical analysis\n\n\nmakes us believe that variation due to mutation or variation due to\n\n\nrecombination during gametogenesis, or due to gene flow or genetic drift\n\n\nresults in changed frequency of genes and alleles in future generation.\n\n\nCoupled to enhance reproductive success, natural selection makes it look\n\n\nlike different population. Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in\n\n\nwhich more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change\n\n\n(more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or\n\n\ndisruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both\n\n\nends of the distribution curve) (Figure 6.8).\n\n\n6.8 A B\nRIEF\n \nA\nCCOUNT\n \nOF\n \nE\nVOLUTION\n\n\nAbout 2000 million years ago (mya) the first cellular forms of life appeared\n\n\non earth.

Giant ferns (pteridophytes) were\n\n\npresent but they all fell to form coal deposits slowly. Some of these land\n\n\nreptiles went back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200\n\n\nmya (e.g.\n \nIchthyosaurs\n). The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs.\n\n\nThe biggest of them, i.e.,\n \nTyrannosaurus rex\n \nwas about 20 feet in height\n\n\nand had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs\n\n\nsuddenly disappeared from the earth. We do not know the true reason.\n\n\nSome say climatic changes killed them. Some say most of them evolved\n\n\ninto birds. The truth may live in between. Small sized reptiles of that era\n\n\nstill exist today.\n\n\nThe first mammals were like shrews. Their fossils are small sized.\n\n\nMammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the\n\n\nmother’s body. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding\n\n\ndanger at least. When reptiles came down mammals took over this earth.\n\n\nThere were in South America mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus,\n\n\nbear, rabbit, etc. Due to continental drift, when South America joined\n\n\nNorth America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna.\n\n\nDue to the same continental drift pouched mammals of Australia survived\n\n\nbecause of lack of competition from any other mammal.\n\n\nLest we forget, some mammals live wholly in water. Whales, dolphins,\n\n\nseals and sea cows are some examples. Evolution of horse, elephant, dog,\n\n\netc., are special stories of evolution. You will learn about these in higher\n\n\nclasses.

Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical\n\n\nfitness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and\n\n\nsocial well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at\n\n\nwork. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health\n\n\nalso increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal\n\n\nmortality.\n\n\nBalanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important\n\n\nto maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial\n\n\nto achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and\n\n\ntheir effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation)\n\n\nagainst infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors\n\n\nand maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources are necessary\n\n\nfor achieving good health.\n\n\nWhen the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is\n\n\nadversely affected, characterised by appearance of various signs and\n\n\nsymptoms, we say that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a\n \ndisease\n. Diseases\n\n\ncan be broadly grouped into\n \ninfectious\n \nand\n \nnon-infectious\n. Diseases\n\n\nwhich are easily transmitted from one person to another, are called\n\n\ninfectious diseases\n.\n \nInfectious diseases are very common and every\n\n\none of us suffers from these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious\n\n\ndiseases like AIDS are fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the\n\n\nmajor cause of death. Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.\n\n\n7.1 C\nOMMON\n \nD\nISEASES\n \nIN\n \nH\nUMANS\n\n\nA wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi,\n\n\nprotozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease-\n\n\ncausing organisms are called\n \npathogens\n. Most parasites are therefore\n\n\npathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The\n\n\npathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply and interfere\n\n\nwith normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional\n\n\ndamage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the\n\n\nhost. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of\n\n\nsurviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive\n\n\nenzymes. A few representative members from different groups of\n\n\npathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused\n\n\nby them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,\n\n\nare also briefly described.\n\n\nSalmonella typhi\n \nis a pathogenic bacterium which causes\n \ntyphoid\n\n\nfever in human beings.

As a result of the infection, the alveoli\n\n\nget filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms\n\n\nof pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases,\n\n\nthe lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.\n \nA healthy\n\n\nperson acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets/aerosols released\n\n\nby an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an\n\n\ninfected person. Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other\n\n\nbacterial diseases in man.\n\n\nMany viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses\n\n\nrepresent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious\n\n\nhuman ailments – the\n \ncommon cold\n. They infect the nose and respiratory\n\n\npassage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal\n\n\ncongestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache,\n\n\ntiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from\n\n\ncough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or\n\n\ntransmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups,\n\n\ndoorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a\n\n\nhealthy person.\n\n\nSome of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might\n\n\nhave heard about\n \nmalaria\n, a disease man has been fighting since many\n\n\nyears.\n \nPlasmodium\n, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different\n\n\nspecies of\n \nPlasmodium\n \n(\nP\n.\n \nvivax\n,\n \nP\n.\n \nmalaria\n \nand\n \nP\n.\n \nfalciparum\n) are\n\n\nresponsible for different types of malaria. Of these, malignant malaria caused\n\n\nby\n \nPlasmodium falciparum\n \nis the most serious one and can even be fatal.\n\n\nLet us take a glance at the life cycle of\n \nPlasmodium\n \n(Figure 7.1).\n\n\nPlasmodium\n \nenters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form)\n\n\nthrough the bite of infected female\n \nAnopheles\n \nmosquito. The parasites\n\n\ninitially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells\n\n\n(RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with\n\n\nrelease of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill\n\n\nand high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female\n \nAnopheles\n\n\nmosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s\n\n\nbody and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within\n\n\nthem to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When\n\n\nthese mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/\n\n\nher body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting\n\n\nto note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and\n\n\nmosquitoes – to complete its life cycle (Figure 7.1); the female\n \nAnopheles\n\n\nmosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too.\nRationalised 2023-24","132\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nEntamoeba histolytica\n \nis a protozoan parasite in the large intestine of\n\n\nhuman which causes\n \namoebiasis\n \n(amoebic dysentery)\n.

These measures are particularly essential where the\n\n\ninfectious agents are transmitted through food and water such as typhoid,\n\n\namoebiasis and ascariasis. In cases of air-borne diseases such as\n\n\npneumonia and common cold, in addition to the above measures, close\nRationalised 2023-24","134\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ncontact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided.\n\n\nFor diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through\n\n\ninsect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the\n\n\nvectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding\n\n\nstagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of\n\n\nhousehold coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing fishes like\n \nGambusia\n\n\nin ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches,\n\n\ndrainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should\n\n\nbe provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such\n\n\nprecautions have become more important especially in the light of recent\n\n\nwidespread incidences of the vector-borne (\nAedes\n \nmosquitoes) diseases\n\n\nlike dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India.\n\n\nThe advancements made in biological science have armed us to\n\n\neffectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and\n\n\nimmunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a\n\n\ndeadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases\n\n\nlike polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a\n\n\nlarge extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will\n\n\nread more in Chapter 10) is at the verge of making available newer and\n\n\nsafer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also\n\n\nenabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases.\n\n\n7.2 I\nMMUNITY\n\n\nEveryday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However,\n\n\nonly a few of these exposures result in disease. Why? This is due to the\n\n\nfact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents.\n\n\nThis overall ability of the host to fight the disease-causing organisms,\n\n\nconferred by the immune system is called\n \nimmunity\n.\n\n\nImmunity is of two types:\n \n(i) Innate immunity\n \nand (ii) Acquired\n\n\nimmunity.\n\n\n7.2.1 Innate Immunity\n\n\nInnate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the\n\n\ntime of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers\n\n\nto the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist\n\n\nof four types of barriers.

It is\n\n\ncharacterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a\n\n\npathogen for the first time it produces a response called\n \nprimary\n\n\nresponse\n \nwhich is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same\n\n\npathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response.\n\n\nThis is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the\n\n\nfirst encounter.\n\n\nThe primary and secondary\n\n\nimmune\n \nresponses\n \nare\n\n\ncarried\n \nout\n \nwith\n \nthe\n \nhelp\n\n\nof\n \ntwo\n \nspecial\n \ntypes\n \nof\n\n\nlymphocytes\n \npresent\n \nin\n \nour\n\n\nblood, i.e.,\n \nB-\nlymphocytes and\n\n\nT-\nlymphocytes.\n\n\nThe B-lymphocytes produce an\n\n\narmy of proteins in response to\n\n\npathogens into our blood to fight\n\n\nwith them. These proteins are\n\n\ncalled\n \nantibodies.\n \nThe\n\n\nT-cells themselves do not secrete\n\n\nantibodies but help B cells to\n\n\nproduce them. Each antibody\n\n\nmolecule has four peptide chains,\n\n\ntwo small called\n \nlight\n \nchains\n \nand\n\n\ntwo longer called\n \nheavy chains\n.\n\n\nHence, an antibody is represented\n\n\nas H\n2\nL\n2\n. Different types of antibodies are produced in our body. IgA, IgM,\n\n\nIgE, IgG are some of them. A cartoon of an antibody is given in Figure\n\n\n7.4. Because these antibodies are found in the blood, the response is also\n\n\ncalled as\n \nhumoral immune response\n. This is one of the two types of our\n\n\nacquired immune response – antibody mediated. The second type is called\n\n\ncell-mediated immune response or\n \ncell-mediated immunity\n \n(CMI). The\n\n\nT-lymphocytes mediate CMI. Very often, when some human organs like\n\n\nheart, eye, liver, kidney fail to function satisfactorily, transplantation is\n\n\nthe only remedy to enable the patient to live a normal life.

Grafts from\n\n\nFigure 7.4\n \nStructure of an antibody molecule\nRationalised 2023-24","136\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\njust any source – an animal, another primate, or any human beings cannot\n\n\nbe made since the grafts would be rejected sooner or later. Tissue\n\n\nmatching, blood group matching are essential before undertaking any\n\n\ngraft/transplant and even after this the patient has to take immuno–\n\n\nsuppresants all his/her life. The body is able to differentiate ‘self ’ and\n\n\n‘nonself’ and the cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the\n\n\ngraft rejection.\n\n\n7.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity\n\n\nWhen a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living\n\n\nor dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host\n\n\nbody. This type of immunity is called\n \nactive immunity.\n \nActive immunity\n\n\nis slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the\n\n\nmicrobes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms\n\n\ngaining\n \naccess\n \ninto\n \nbody\n \nduring\n \nnatural\n \ninfection\n \ninduce\n \nactive\n\n\nimmunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect\n\n\nthe body against foreign agents, it is called\n \npassive immunity\n.\n \nDo you\n\n\nknow why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new-\n\n\nborn infant\n? The yellowish fluid\n \ncolostrum\n \nsecreted by mother during\n\n\nthe initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies (IgA) to protect the\n\n\ninfant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother,\n\n\nthrough the placenta during pregnancy.\n \nThese are some examples of\n\n\npassive immunity.\n\n\n7.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation\n\n\nThe principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of\n\n\n‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic\n\n\nproteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are\n\n\nintroduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against\n\n\nthese antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual\n\n\ninfection. The vaccines also generate memory – B and T-cells that recognise\n\n\nthe pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the\n\n\ninvaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected\n\n\nwith some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required\n\n\nas in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or\n\n\nantitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases\n\n\nof snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed\n\n\nantibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called\n\n\npassive immunisation\n.\n\n\nRecombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic\n\n\npolypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using\n\n\nthis approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability\n\n\nfor immunisation, e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast.\nRationalised 2023-24","HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n\n137\n\n\n7.2.5 Allergies\n\n\nWhen you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing,\n\n\nwheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your\n\n\nsymptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you? Some of us are sensitive\n\n\nto some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could\n\n\nbe because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different\n\n\nplaces.\n\n\nThe\n \nexaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens\n\n\npresent in the environment is called\n \nallergy\n. The substances to which\n\n\nsuch an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies\n\n\nproduced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are\n\n\nmites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions\n\n\ninclude sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.\n\n\nAllergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin\n\n\nfrom the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is\n\n\nexposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the\n\n\nreactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and\n\n\nsteroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day\n\n\nlife style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to\n\n\nallergens – more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from\n\n\nallergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be\n\n\nbecause of the protected environment provided early in life.\n\n\n7.2.6 Auto Immunity\n\n\nMemory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based\n\n\non the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e.g., pathogens) from self-\n\n\ncells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of\n\n\nthis ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish\n\n\nforeign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental\n\n\nimmunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and\n\n\nother unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage\n\n\nto the body and is called\n \nauto-immune\n \ndisease. Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\nwhich affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease.\n\n\n7.2.7 Immune System in the Body\n\n\nThe human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells\n\n\nand soluble molecules like antibodies. As you have read, immune system\n\n\nis unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to\n\n\nthese and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important\n\n\nrole\n \nin\n \nallergic\n \nreactions,\n \nauto-immune\n \ndiseases\n \nand\n \norgan\n\n\ntransplantation.\n\n\nLymphoid organs:\n \nThese are the organs where origin and/or maturation\n\n\nand proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs\n\n\nare\n \nbone marrow\n \nand\n \nthymus\n \nwhere immature lymphocytes differentiate\nRationalised 2023-24","138\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ninto antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. After maturation the\n\n\nlymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen,\n\n\nlymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and\n\n\nappendix. The secondary lymphoid organs provide the sites for\n\n\ninteraction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate\n\n\nto become effector cells. The location of various lymphoid organs\n\n\nin the human body is shown in Figure 7.5.\n\n\nThe bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all\n\n\nblood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus\n\n\nis a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the\n\n\nbreastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but\n\n\nkeeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is\n\n\nattained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow\n\n\nand thymus provide micro-environments for the development\n\n\nand maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean-\n\n\nshaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes.\n\n\nIt acts as a filter of the blood by trapping blood-borne micro-\n\n\norganisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes.\n\n\nThe lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different\n\n\npoints along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the\n\n\nmicro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph\n\n\nand tissue fluid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for\n\n\nthe activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune\n\n\nresponse.\n\n\nThere is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major\n\n\ntracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called\n \nmucosa-\n\n\nassociated lymphoid tissue\n \n(MALT). It constitutes about 50 per cent of\n\n\nthe lymphoid tissue in human body.\n\n\n7.3 AIDS\n\n\nThe word AIDS stands for\n \nAcquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome\n.\n\n\nThis means deficiency of immune system, acquired during the lifetime of\n\n\nan individual indicating that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’\n\n\nmeans a group of symptoms. AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in the\n\n\nlast twenty-five years or so, it has spread all over the world killing more\n\n\nthan 25 million persons.\n\n\nAIDS is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV), a\n\n\nmember of a group of viruses called\n \nretrovirus\n, which have an envelope\n\n\nenclosing the RNA genome (Figure 7.6). Transmission of HIV-infection\n\n\ngenerally occurs by (a) sexual contact with infected person, (b) by\n\n\ntransfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) by sharing\n\n\ninfected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) from\n\n\ninfected mother to her child through placenta. So, people who are at high\n\n\nrisk of getting this infection includes - individuals who have multiple\n\n\nFigure 7.5\n \nDiagrammatic\n\n\nrepresentation\n\n\nof Lymph nodes\nRationalised 2023-24","HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n\n139\n\n\nFigure 7.6\n \nReplication of retrovirus\n\n\nsexual partners, drug addicts who take drugs intravenously, individuals\n\n\nwho require repeated blood transfusions and children born to an HIV\n\n\ninfected mother.\n \nDo you know –when do people need repeated blood\n\n\ntransfusion? Find out and make a list of such conditions.\n \nIt is important\n\n\nto note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it\n\n\nspreads only through body fluids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical\n\n\nand psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are\n\n\nnot isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between\n\n\nthe infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary\n\n\nfrom a few months to many years (usually 5-10 years).\nRationalised 2023-24","140\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nAfter getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages\n\n\nwhere RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of\n\n\nthe enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host\n\n\ncell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 7.6).\n\n\nThe macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV\n\n\nfactory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into helper T-lymphocytes (T\nH\n), replicates\n\n\nand produce progeny viruses. The progeny viruses released in the blood attack\n\n\nother helper T-lymphocytes. This is repeated leading to a progressive decrease\n\n\nin the number of helper T-lymphocytes in the body of the infected person.\n\n\nDuring this period, the person suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight\n\n\nloss. Due to decrease in the number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts\n\n\nsuffering from infections that could have been otherwise overcome such as\n\n\nthose due to bacteria especially\n \nMycobacterium\n, viruses, fungi and even\n\n\nparasites like\n \nToxoplasma.\n \nThe patient becomes so immuno-deficient that\n\n\nhe/she is unable to protect himself/herself against these infections. A widely\n\n\nused diagnostic test for AIDS is\n \nenzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay\n\n\n(ELISA). Treatment of AIDS with anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective.\n\n\nThey can only prolong the life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is\n\n\ninevitable.\n\n\nPrevention of AIDS :\n \nAs AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option.\n\n\nMoreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour\n\n\npatterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia\n\n\nor typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns\n\n\n(from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse\n\n\nmay be ignorance and it has been rightly said – “don’t die of ignorance”.\n\n\nIn our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other\n\n\nnon-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people\n\n\nabout AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the\n\n\nspreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from\n\n\nHIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public\n\n\nand private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling\n\n\ndrug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for\n\n\nHIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up.\n\n\nInfection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be\n\n\nhidden – since then, the infection may spread to many more people.\n\n\nHIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being\n\n\nshunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt\n\n\nwith in a collective manner – the chances of wider spread of the disease\n\n\nincrease manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society\n\n\nand medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n\n7.4 C\nANCER\n\n\nCancer\n \nis one of the most dreaded diseases of human beings and is a major\n\n\ncause of death all over the globe. More than a million Indians suffer from\nRationalised 2023-24","HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n\n141\n\n\ncancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms\n\n\nthat underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells,\n\n\nits treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of\n\n\nresearch in biology and medicine.\n\n\nIn our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and\n\n\nregulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory\n\n\nmechanisms. Normal cells show a property called\n \ncontact inhibition\n \nby\n\n\nvirtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.\n\n\nCancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous\n\n\ncells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called\n \ntumors\n.\n\n\nTumors are of two types: benign and malignant.\n \nBenign tumors\n \nnormally\n\n\nremain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts\n\n\nof the body and cause little damage. The\n \nmalignant tumors\n,\n \non the\n\n\nother hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor\n\n\ncells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the\n\n\nsurrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they\n\n\nalso starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed\n\n\nfrom such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they\n\n\nget lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called\n\n\nmetastasis\n \nis the most feared property of malignant tumors.\n\n\nCauses of cancer :\n \nTransformation of normal cells into cancerous\n\n\nneoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.\n\n\nThese agents are called\n \ncarcinogens\n. Ionising radiations like X-rays and\n\n\ngamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage\n\n\nleading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present\n\n\nin tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.\n\n\nCancer causing viruses called\n \noncogenic viruses\n \nhave genes called\n \nviral\n\n\noncogenes\n. Furthermore, several genes called\n \ncellular oncogenes\n\n\n(\nc-onc\n) or\n \nproto oncogenes\n \nhave been identified in normal cells which,\n\n\nwhen activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic\n\n\ntransformation of the cells.\n\n\nCancer detection and diagnosis :\n \nEarly detection of cancers is essential\n\n\nas it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer\n\n\ndetection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue\n\n\nand blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of\n\n\nleukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections\n\n\nis stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by\n\n\na pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X-rays), CT (computed\n\n\ntomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to\n\n\ndetect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X-rays\n\n\nto generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI\n\n\nuses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect\n\n\npathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.\n\n\nAntibodies against cancer -specific antigens are also used for\n\n\ndetection of certain cancers.

Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to\n\n\nparticular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco\n\n\nsmoke in case of lung cancer).\n\n\nTreatment of cancer :\n \nThe common approaches for treatment of cancer\n\n\nare surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy,\n\n\ntumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues\n\n\nsurrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used\n\n\nto kill cancerous cells. Some of these are specific for particular tumors.\n\n\nMajority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers\n\n\nare treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\n\nTumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by\n\n\nimmune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called\n\n\nbiological response modifiers such as\n \nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\n-interferon\n \nwhich activates their\n\n\nimmune system and helps in destroying the tumor.\n\n\n7.5 D\nRUGS\n \nAND\n \nA\nLCOHOL\n \nA\nBUSE\n\n\nSurveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on\n\n\nthe rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it\n\n\ncould result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance\n\n\nwould enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous\n\n\nbehaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles.\n\n\nThe drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids\n\n\nand coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from flowering plants.\n\n\nSome are obtained from fungi.\n\n\nOpioids\n \nare the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present\n\n\nin our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin\n\n\n(Figure 7.7), commonly called\n \nsmack\n \nis chemically diacetylmorphine which\n\n\nis a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound.

Tobacco has been used\n\n\nby human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used\n\n\nas a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances\n\n\nincluding nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to\n\n\nrelease adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of\n\n\nwhich raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated\n\n\nwith increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat,\n\n\nbronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco\n\n\nchewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.\n\n\nSmoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces\n\n\nthe concentration of haembound oxygen. This causes oxygen deficiency\n\n\nin the body.\n\n\nWhen one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory\n\n\nwarning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking\n\n\nand says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in\n\n\nsociety, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking\n\n\nand chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to\n\n\navoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to\n\n\nget rid of the habit.\n\n\n7.5.1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse\n\n\nAdolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child\n\n\nbecomes mature in terms of his/her attitudes and beliefs for effective\n\n\nparticipation in society. The period between 12-18 years of age may\n\n\nbe thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a\n\n\nbridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied\n\n\nby several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a\n\n\nvery vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an\n\n\nindividual.\n\n\nCuriosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation,\n\n\nconstitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug\n\n\nand alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him/her to\n\n\nexperiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived\n\n\nas benefits, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol\n\n\nmay be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts\n\n\nusing these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to\n\n\nexcel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in\n\n\npersuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception\n\n\namong youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or\n\n\nalcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits.\n\n\nTelevision, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this\n\n\nperception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug\n\n\nand alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive\n\n\nfamily structures and peer pressure.\nRationalised 2023-24","HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n\n145\n\n\n7.5.2 Addiction and Dependence\n\n\nBecause of the perceived benefits, drugs are frequently used repeatedly.\n\n\nThe most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent\n\n\naddictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological\n\n\nattachment to certain effects – such as euphoria and a temporary feeling\n\n\nof well-being – associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to\n\n\ntake them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes\n\n\nself-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the\n\n\nreceptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors\n\n\nrespond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake\n\n\nand addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of\n\n\nthese drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the\n\n\naddictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle\n\n\nleading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able\n\n\nto get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets\n\n\naddicted and becomes dependent on their use.\n\n\nDependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic\n\n\nand unpleasant\n \nwithdrawal syndrome\n \nif regular dose of drugs/alcohol\n\n\nis abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,\n\n\nnausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.\n\n\nIn some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life\n\n\nthreatening and the person may need medical supervision.\n\n\nDependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to\n\n\nget sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social\n\n\nadjustment problems.\n\n\n7.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse\n\n\nThe immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested\n\n\nin the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive\n\n\ndoses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure,\n\n\nheart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their\n\n\nintake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even\n\n\ndeaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse\n\n\namong youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained\n\n\nabsence from school/college, lack of interest in personal hygiene,\n\n\nwithdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious\n\n\nbehaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of\n\n\ninterest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations\n\n\nin weight, appetite, etc.\n\n\nThere may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/alcohol\n\n\nabuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/alcohol he/she\n\n\nmay turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the\n\n\nperson who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/alcohol addict\n\n\nbecomes the cause of mental and financial distress to his/her entire family\n\n\nand friends.\nRationalised 2023-24","146\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThose who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein\n\n\nusing a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious\n\n\ninfections like AIDS and Hepatitis B.

Both can be transmitted\n\n\nthrough sexual contact or infected blood.\n\n\nThe use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects.\n\n\nIt could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and\n\n\nalcohol damages nervous system and liver\n \n(cirrhosis\n). The use of drugs\n\n\nand alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus.\n\n\nAnother misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance\n\n\ntheir performance. They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids,\n\n\ndiuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and\n\n\nbulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic\n\n\nperformance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females\n\n\ninclude masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness,\n\n\nmood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair\n\n\ngrowth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.\n\n\nIn males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings,\n\n\ndepression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production,\n\n\npotential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature\n\n\nbaldness, enlargement of the prostate gland.\n \nThese effects may be\n\n\npermanent with prolonged use.

In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special\n\n\nresponsibility.

It is a state of complete physical,\n\n\nmental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid,\n\n\ncholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others\n\n\nare a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases\n\n\nlike malaria especially one caused by\n \nPlasmodium falciparum\n, if not\n\n\ntreated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene,\n\n\npublic health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination\n\n\nof drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation\n\n\nare very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays\n\n\nthe major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to\n\n\ndisease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin,\n\n\nmucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears,\n\n\nsaliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens\n\n\ninto our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body,\n\n\nspecific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated\n\n\nimmune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has\n\n\nmemory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune\n\n\nresponse is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection\n\n\n(ii)\n \nEducation and counselling -\n \nEducating and counselling him/\n\n\nher to face problems and stresses, and to accept disappointments\n\n\nand failures as a part of life. It would also be worthwhile to channelise\n\n\nthe child’s energy into healthy pursuits like sports, reading, music,\n\n\nyoga and other extracurricular activities.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nSeeking help from parents and peers -\n \nHelp from parents and\n\n\npeers should be sought immediately so that they can guide\n\n\nappropriately. Help may even be sought from close and trusted\n\n\nfriends. Besides getting proper advise to sort out their problems,\n\n\nthis would help young to vent their feelings of anxiety and guilt.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nLooking for danger signs -\n \nAlert parents and teachers need to\n\n\nlook for and identify the danger signs discussed above. Even friends,\n\n\nif they find someone using drugs or alcohol, should not hesitate to\n\n\nbring this to the notice of parents or teacher in the best interests of\n\n\nthe person concerned. Appropriate measures would then be required\n\n\nto diagnose the malady and the underlying causes. This would help\n\n\nin initiating proper remedial steps or treatment.\n\n\n(v)\n \nSeeking professional and medical help -\n \nA lot of help is available\n\n\nin the form of highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists, and de-\n\n\naddiction and rehabilitation programmes to help individuals who\n\n\nhave unfortunately got in the quagmire of drug/alcohol abuse.

Some of the most important\n\n\ncontributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter.\n\n\n8.1 M\nICROBES\n \nIN\n \nH\nOUSEHOLD\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n\n\nYou would be surprised to know that we use microbes or products\n\n\nderived from them everyday. A common example is the production of\n\n\ncurd from milk. Micro-organisms such as\n \nLactobacillus\n \nand others\n\n\ncommonly called\n \nlactic acid bacteria (LAB)\n \ngrow in milk and convert it\n\n\nto curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and\n\n\npartially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the\n\n\nfresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at\n\n\nsuitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which\n\n\nalso improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B\n12\n. In our\n\n\nstomach too, the LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-\n\n\ncausing microbes.\n\n\nThe dough, which is used for making foods such as\n \ndosa\n \nand\n \nidli\n \nis\n\n\nalso fermented by bacteria. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to\n\n\nthe production of\n \nCO\n2\n \ngas.\n \nCan you tell which metabolic pathway is\n\n\ntaking place resulting in the formation of CO\n2\n? Where do you think the\n\n\nbacteria for these fermentations come from?\n \nSimilarly the dough, which\n\n\nis\n \nused\n \nfor\n \nmaking\n \nbread,\n \nis\n \nfermented\n \nusing\n \nbaker’s\n \nyeast\n\n\n(\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n). A number of\n \ntraditional drinks and foods\n\n\nare also made by fermentation by the microbes. ‘Toddy’, a traditional\n\n\ndrink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from\n\n\npalms. Microbes are also used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-\n\n\nshoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which\n\n\nmicrobes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their\n\n\ncharacteristic texture, flavour and taste, the specificity coming from the\n\n\nmicrobes used. For example, the large holes in ‘Swiss cheese’ are due to\n\n\nproduction\n \nof\n \na\n \nlarge\n \namount\n \nof\n \nCO\n2\n \nby\n \na\n \nbacterium\n \nnamed\n\n\nPropionibacterium sharmanii\n.\n \nThe ‘Roquefort cheese’ are ripened by\n\n\ngrowing a specific fungi on them, which gives them a particular flavour.\n\n\n8.2\n \nM\nICROBES\n \nIN\n \nI\nNDUSTRIAL\n \nP\nRODUCTS\n\n\nEven in industry, microbes are used to synthesise a number of products\n\n\nvaluable to human beings.

Antibiotics are chemical\n\n\nsubstances, which are produced by some microbes and can kill or retard\n\n\nthe growth of other (disease-causing) microbes.\n\n\nYou are familiar with the commonly used antibiotic Penicillin. Do you\n\n\nknow that Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered, and it was a\n\n\nchance discovery?\n \nAlexander Fleming while working on\n \nStaphylococci\n\n\nbacteria, once observed a mould growing in one of his unwashed culture\n\n\nplates around which\n \nStaphylococci\n \ncould not grow. He found out that it\n\n\nwas due to a chemical produced by the mould and he named it Penicillin\n\n\nafter the mould\n \nPenicillium notatum.\n \nHowever, its full potential as an\n\n\neffective antibiotic was established much later by Ernest Chain and\n\n\nHoward Florey. This antibiotic\n \nwas extensively used to treat American\n\n\nsoldiers wounded in World War II. Fleming, Chain and Florey were awarded\n\n\nthe Nobel Prize in 1945, for this discovery.\n\n\nFigure 8.5\n \nFermentation Plant\n\n\nFigure 8.4\n \nFermentors\nRationalised 2023-24","153\n\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\n\nAfter Penicillin, other antibiotics were also purified from other\n\n\nmicrobes.\n \nCan you name some other antibiotics and find out their\n\n\nsources?\n \nAntibiotics have greatly improved our capacity to treat deadly\n\n\ndiseases such as plague, whooping cough (\nkali khansi\n \n), diphtheria (\ngal\n\n\nghotu\n) and leprosy (\nkusht rog\n), which used to kill millions all over the\n\n\nglobe. Today, we cannot imagine a world without antibiotics.\n\n\n8.2.3 Chemicals, Enzymes and other Bioactive Molecules\n\n\nMicrobes are also used for commercial and industrial production of\n\n\ncertain chemicals like organic acids, alcohols and enzymes. Examples of\n\n\nacid producers are\n \nAspergillus niger\n \n(a fungus) of citric acid,\n \nAcetobacter\n\n\naceti\n \n(a bacterium) of acetic acid;\n \nClostridium butylicum\n \n(a bacterium) of\n\n\nbutyric acid and\n \nLactobacillus\n \n(a bacterium) of lactic acid.\n\n\nYeast (\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae)\n \nis used for commercial production\n\n\nof ethanol. Microbes are also used for production of enzymes. Lipases are\n\n\nused in detergent formulations and are helpful in removing oily stains\n\n\nfrom the laundry. You must have noticed that bottled fruit juices bought\n\n\nfrom the market are clearer as compared to those made at home. This is\n\n\nbecause the bottled juices are clarified by the use of pectinases and\n\n\nproteases. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium\n \nStreptococcus\n \nand\n\n\nmodified by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing\n\n\nclots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial\n\n\ninfarction leading to heart attack.\n\n\nAnother bioactive molecule, cyclosporin A, that is used as an\n\n\nimmunosuppressive agent in organ-transplant patients, is produced by\n\n\nthe fungus\n \nTrichoderma polysporum\n. Statins produced by the yeast\n\n\nMonascus purpureus\n \nhave been commercialised as blood-cholesterol\n\n\nlowering agents. It acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible\n\n\nfor synthesis of cholesterol.\n\n\n8.3 M\nICROBES\n \nIN\n \nS\nEWAGE\n \nT\nREATMENT\n\n\nWe know that large quantities of waste water are generated everyday in\n\n\ncities and towns. A major component of this waste water is human excreta.\n\n\nThis municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large\n\n\namounts of organic matter and microbes. Many of which are pathogenic.\n\n\nHave you ever wondered where this huge quantity of sewage or urban\n\n\nwaste water is disposed off daily? This cannot be discharged into natural\n\n\nwater bodies like rivers and streams directly – you can understand why.\n\n\nBefore disposal, hence, sewage is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs)\n\n\nto make it less polluting. Treatment of waste water is done by the\nRationalised 2023-24","154\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nheterotrophic microbes naturally present in\n\n\nthe sewage. This treatment is carried out in\n\n\ntwo stages:\n\n\nPrimary treatment\n \n: These treatment\n\n\nsteps basically involve physical removal of\n\n\nparticles – large and small – from the sewage\n\n\nthrough filtration and sedimentation. These\n\n\nare removed in stages; initially, floating debris\n\n\nis removed by sequential filtration. Then the\n\n\ngrit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by\n\n\nsedimentation. All solids that settle form the\n\n\nprimary sludge\n, and the supernatant forms\n\n\nthe effluent.\n \nThe effluent from the primary\n\n\nsettling tank is taken for secondary treatment.\n\n\nSecondary treatment or Biological treatment\n \n: The primary\n\n\neffluent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 8.6) where it is\n\n\nconstantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows\n\n\nvigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into\n \nflocs\n \n(masses of\n\n\nbacteria\n \nassociated\n \nwith\n \nfungal\n \nfilaments\n \nto\n \nform\n \nmesh\n \nlike\n\n\nstructures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part\n\n\nof the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the\n\n\nBOD (biochemical oxygen demand)\n \nof the effluent. BOD refers to\n\n\nthe amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic\n\n\nmatter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage\n\n\nwater is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the\n\n\nrate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water\n\n\nand thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present\n\n\nin the water. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting\n\n\npotential.\n\n\nOnce the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced significantly, the\n\n\neffluent is then passed into a settling tank where the bacterial ‘flocs’ are\n\n\nallowed to sediment. This sediment is called\n \nactivated sludge\n. A small\n\n\npart of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to\n\n\nserve as the inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped\n\n\ninto large tanks called\n \nanaerobic sludge digesters\n. Here, other kinds\n\n\nof bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi\n\n\nin the sludge. During this digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases\n\n\nsuch as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases\n\n\nform\n \nbiogas\n \nand can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable.\n\n\nThe effluent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released\n\n\ninto natural water bodies like rivers and streams. An aerial view of such\n\n\na plant is shown in Figure 8.7.\n\n\nFigure 8.6\n \nSecondary treatment\nRationalised 2023-24","155\n\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\n\nYou can appreciate how microbes play a major\n\n\nrole in treating millions of gallons of waste water\n\n\neveryday across the globe. This methodology has\n\n\nbeen practiced for more than a century now, in\n\n\nalmost all parts of the world.

However the\n\n\nnumber of sewage treatment plants has not\n\n\nincreased enough to treat such large quantities.\n\n\nSo the untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to\n\n\ntheir pollution and increase in water-borne diseases.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated\n \nGanga Action\n\n\nPlan\n \nand\n \nYamuna Action Plan\n \nto save these major rivers of our country\n\n\nfrom pollution. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number\n\n\nof sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged\n\n\nin the rivers.

You have learnt\n\n\nthat microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during\n\n\ngrowth and metabolism. The type of the gas produced depends upon the\n\n\nmicrobes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in\n\n\nrelation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of\n\n\nbeverages, the main gas produced was CO\n2.\n. However, certain bacteria,\n\n\nwhich grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount\n\n\nof methane along with CO\n2\n \nand H\n2\n. These bacteria are collectively called\n\n\nmethanogens\n, and one such common bacterium is\n \nMethanobacterium\n.\n\n\nThese bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during\n\n\nsewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of\n\n\nstomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle\n\n\nis also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the\n\n\nbreakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of\n\n\ncattle.\n \nDo you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose\n\n\npresent in our foods?\n \nThus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called\n\n\ngobar\n, is rich in these bacteria. Dung can be used for generation of biogas,\n\n\ncommonly called\n \ngobar gas\n.\n\n\nThe biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10-15 feet deep) in which\n\n\nbio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed. A floating cover is\n\n\nFigure 8.7\n \nAn aerial view of a sewage plant\nRationalised 2023-24","156\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nplaced over the slurry, which\n\n\nkeeps on rising as the gas is\n\n\nproduced in the tank due to the\n\n\nmicrobial activity. The biogas\n\n\nplant has an outlet, which is\n\n\nconnected to a pipe to supply\n\n\nbiogas to nearby houses.

In modern society, these problems have been tackled\n\n\nincreasingly by the use of chemicals – by use of insecticides and pesticides.\n\n\nThese chemicals are toxic and extremely harmful, to human beings and\n\n\nanimals alike, and have been polluting our environment (soil, ground\n\n\nwater), fruits, vegetables and crop plants. Our soil is also polluted through\n\n\nour use of weedicides to remove weeds.\n\n\nBiological control of pests and diseases:\n \nIn agriculture, there is a\n\n\nmethod of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than\n\n\nintroduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity\n\n\nfurthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable\n\n\nit is. The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the\n\n\ninsects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead\n\n\nare kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances\n\n\nwithin a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to the ‘conventional’\n\n\nfarming practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful\n\n\nFigure 8.8\n \nA typical biogas plant\nRationalised 2023-24","157\n\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\n\nand harmful life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that\n\n\nseeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the\n\n\nmyriad of organisms that constitute the field fauna and flora. The organic\n\n\nfarmer holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often\n\n\ndescribed as pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, for without\n\n\nthem the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon\n\n\nthem as food or hosts would not be able to survive. Thus, the use of\n\n\nbiocontrol measures will greatly reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals\n\n\nand pesticides. An important part of the biological farming approach is\n\n\nto become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the field,\n\n\npredators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding\n\n\nand the habitats that they prefer. This will help develop appropriate means\n\n\nof biocontrol.\n\n\nThe very familiar beetle with red and black markings – the Ladybird,\n\n\nand Dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes,\n\n\nrespectively. An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be\n\n\nintroduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is the bacteria\n \nBacillus\n\n\nthuringiensis\n \n(often written as\n \nBt\n \n). These are available in sachets as dried\n\n\nspores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants\n\n\nsuch as brassicas and fruit trees, where these are eaten by the insect\n\n\nlarvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get\n\n\nkilled. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects\n\n\nunharmed. Because of the development of methods of genetic engineering\n\n\nin the last decade or so, the scientists have introduced\n \nB. thuringiensis\n\n\ntoxin genes into plants. Such plants are resistant to attack by insect pests.\n\n\nBt-cotton\n \nis one such example, which is being cultivated in some states\n\n\nof our country.

Trichoderma\n \nspecies are free-living\n\n\nfungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective\n\n\nbiocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.\n\n\nBaculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods.\n\n\nThe majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents are in the\n\n\ngenus\n \nNucleopolyhedrovirus.\n \nThese viruses are excellent candidates for\n\n\nspecies-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications. They have\n\n\nbeen shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, fish\n\n\nor even on non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneficial\n\n\ninsects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest\n\n\nmanagement (IPM) programme, or when an ecologically sensitive area is\n\n\nbeing treated.\n\n\n8.6 M\nICROBES\n \nAS\n \nB\nIOFERTILISERS\n\n\nWith our present day life styles environmental pollution is a major cause\n\n\nof concern. The use of the chemical fertilisers to meet the ever-increasing\nRationalised 2023-24","158\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ndemand of agricultural produce has contributed significantly to\n\n\nthis pollution. Of course, we have now realised that there are problems\n\n\nassociated with the overuse of chemical fertilisers and there is a\n\n\nlarge pressure to switch to\n \norganic farming\n \n– the use of\n \nbiofertilisers\n.\n\n\nBiofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil.\n\n\nThe main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.\n\n\nYou have studied about the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants\n\n\nformed by the symbiotic association of\n \nRhizobium\n. These bacteria fix\n\n\natmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plant as\n\n\nnutrient. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in\n\n\nthe soil (examples\n \nAzospirillum\n \nand\n \nAzotobacter\n), thus enriching the\n\n\nnitrogen content of the soil.\n\n\nFungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants\n\n\n(\nmycorrhiza\n). Many members of the genus\n \nGlomus\n \nform mycorrhiza.\n\n\nThe fungal symbiont in these associations absorbs phosphorus from\n\n\nsoil and passes it to the plant. Plants having such associations show\n\n\nother benefits also, such as resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance\n\n\nto salinity and drought, and an overall increase in plant growth and\n\n\ndevelopment.\n \nCan you tell what advantage the fungus derives from\n\n\nthis association?\n\n\nCyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic\n\n\nand terrestrial environments many of which can fix atmospheric nitrogen,\n\n\ne.g.\n \nAnabaena\n,\n \nNostoc\n,\n \nOscillatoria,\n \netc. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria\n\n\nserve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter\n\n\nto the soil and increase its fertility. Currently, in our country, a number\n\n\nof biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use\n\n\nthese regularly in their fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce\n\n\ndependence on chemical fertilisers.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nMicrobes are a very important component of life on earth. Not all\n\n\nmicrobes are pathogenic. Many microbes are very useful to human\n\n\nbeings. We use microbes and microbially derived products almost every\n\n\nday. Bacteria called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk to convert it\n\n\ninto curd. The dough, which is used to make bread, is fermented by\n\n\nyeast called\n \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n. Certain dishes such as\n \nidli\n \nand\n\n\ndosa\n, are made from dough fermented by microbes. Bacteria and fungi\n\n\nare used to impart particular texture, taste and flavor to cheese. Microbes\n\n\nare used to produce industrial products like lactic acid, acetic acid\n\n\nand alcohol, which are used in a variety of processes in the industry.\n\n\nAntibiotics like penicillins produced by useful microbes are used to kill\n\n\ndisease-causing harmful microbes.

The former provides opportunities for variations\n\n\nand formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which\n\n\nmay be beneficial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual\n\n\nreproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction\n\n\npermits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and\n\n\nanimal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of\n\n\nundesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic\n\n\nengineering which include creation of\n \nrecombinant DNA\n, use of\n\n\ngene cloning\n \nand\n \ngene transfer\n, overcome this limitation and allows us\n\n\nto isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without\n\n\nintroducing undesirable genes into the target organism.\n\n\nDo you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow\n\n\ntransferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would\n\n\nnot be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But,\n\n\nwhen it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply\n\n\nand be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because the alien piece\n\n\nof DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to\n\n\nreplicate. In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the\n\n\norigin of replication,\n \nwhich is responsible for initiating replication.\n\n\nTherefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism\n\n\nit needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence\n\n\nknown as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the\n\n\norigin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and\n\n\nmultiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as\n \ncloning\n \nor\n\n\nmaking multiple identical copies of any template DNA.\n\n\nLet us now focus on the first instance of the construction of an artificial\n\n\nrecombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the first recombinant\n\n\nDNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic\n\n\nresistance with a native\n \nplasmid\n \n(autonomously replicating circular\n\n\nextra-chromosomal DNA) of\n \nSalmonella typhimurium\n. Stanley Cohen and\n\n\nHerbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic\n\n\nresistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was\n\n\nresponsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at\n\n\nspecific locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called\nRationalised 2023-24","BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n\n165\n\n\n‘molecular scissors’–\n \nrestriction enzymes\n. The cut piece of DNA was\n\n\nthen linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as\n \nvectors\n \nto\n\n\ntransfer the piece of DNA attached to it. You probably know that mosquito\n\n\nacts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body.\n\n\nIn the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece\n\n\nof DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene\n\n\nwith the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase,\n\n\nwhich acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new\n\n\ncombination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created\n \nin vitro\n\n\nand is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into\n\n\nEscherichia coli\n, a bacterium closely related to\n \nSalmonella,\n \nit could\n\n\nreplicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple\n\n\ncopies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in\n\n\nE. coli\n \nwas called\n \ncloning\n \nof antibiotic resistance gene in\n \nE. coli\n.\n\n\nYou can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically\n\n\nmodifying an organism —\n\n\n(i)\n \nidentification of DNA with desirable genes;\n\n\n(ii)\n \nintroduction of the identified DNA into the host;\n\n\n(iii)\n \nmaintenance of introduced DNA in the host and transfer of the DNA\n\n\nto its progeny.\n\n\n9.2\n \nT\nOOLS\n \nOF\n \nR\nECOMBINANT\n \nDNA T\nECHNOLOGY\n\n\nNow we know from the foregoing discussion that genetic engineering or\n\n\nrecombinant DNA technology can be accomplished only if we have the\n\n\nkey tools, i.e., restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors\n\n\nand the host organism. Let us try to understand some of these in detail.\n\n\n9.2.1 Restriction Enzymes\n\n\nIn the year 1963, the two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth\n\n\nof bacteriophage in\n \nEscherichia coli\n \nwere isolated. One of these added\n\n\nmethyl groups to DNA, while the other cut DNA. The later was called\n\n\nrestriction endonuclease\n.\n\n\nThe first restriction endonuclease–\nHind II\n, whose functioning\n\n\ndepended on a specific DNA nucleotide sequence was isolated and\n\n\ncharacterised five years later. It was found that\n \nHind II\n \nalways cut DNA\n\n\nmolecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of\n\n\nsix\n \nbase\n \npairs.\n \nThis\n \nspecific\n \nbase\n \nsequence\n \nis\n \nknown\n \nas\n \nthe\n\n\nrecognition sequence\n \nfor\n \nHind II\n. Besides\n \nHind II\n, today we know more\n\n\nthan 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains\n\n\nof bacteria each of which recognise different recognition sequences.\n\n\nThe convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name\n\n\ncomes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of\n\n\nthe prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes from\n\n\nE\ns\ncherichia coli\n \nRY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of\nRationalised 2023-24","166\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nstrain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which\n\n\nthe enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.\n\n\nRestriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called\n\n\nnucleases\n. These are of two kinds;\n \nexonucleases\n \nand\n \nendonucleases\n.\n\n\nExonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA whereas,\n\n\nendonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA.\n\n\nEach restriction endonuclease functions by ‘inspecting’ the length of\n\n\na DNA sequence. Once it finds its specific recognition sequence, it\n\n\nwill bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double\n\n\nhelix\n \nat\n \nspecific\n \npoints\n \nin\n \ntheir\n \nsugar -phosphate\n \nbackbones\n\n\n(Figure 9.1).

These are groups of letters\n\n\nthat form the same words when read both forward and backward,\n\n\ne.g., “MALAYALAM”. As against a word-palindrome where the same\n\n\nword is read in both directions, the palindrome in DNA is a sequence\n\n\nof base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation of\nRationalised 2023-24","BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n\n167\n\n\nreading is kept the same. For example, the following sequences reads\n\n\nthe same on the two strands in 5\n'\n \nà\n \n3\n'\n \ndirection.

This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are\n\n\noverhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand (Figure 9.1).

These fragments\n\n\ncan be separated by a technique known as\n \ngel electrophoresis\n. Since\n\n\nDNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated\n\n\nby forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through\n\n\na medium/matrix. Nowadays the most commonly used matrix is agarose\n\n\nwhich is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds. The DNA fragments\n\n\nseparate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided\n\n\nby the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it\n\n\nmoves.\n \nLook at the Figure 9.3 and guess at which end of the gel the\n\n\nsample was loaded.\n\n\nThe separated DNA fragments can be\n\n\nvisualised only after staining the DNA\n\n\nwith a compound known as ethidium\n\n\nbromide followed by exposure to UV\n\n\nradiation (you cannot see pure DNA\n\n\nfragments in the visible light and\n\n\nwithout staining).

Some plasmids\n\n\nmay have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have\n\n\n15-100 copies per cell. Their numbers can go even higher. If we are able\n\n\nto link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can\n\n\nmultiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or\n\n\nbacteriophage. Vectors used at present, are engineered in such a way\n\n\nthat they help easy linking of foreign DNA and selection of recombinants\n\n\nfrom non-recombinants.\n\n\nFigure 9.3\n \nA typical agarose gel\n\n\nelectrophoresis showing\n\n\nmigration of undigested\n\n\n(lane 1) and digested set of\n\n\nDNA fragments (lane 2 to 4)\nRationalised 2023-24","BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n\n169\n\n\nThe following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning\n\n\ninto a vector.\n\n\n(i)\n \nOrigin of replication (ori)\n \n:\n \nThis is a sequence from where\n\n\nreplication starts and any piece of DNA when linked to this sequence\n\n\ncan be made to replicate within the host cells. This sequence is also\n\n\nresponsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA. So,\n\n\nif one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA it should be\n\n\ncloned in a vector whose origin support high copy number.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nSelectable marker\n \n:\n \nIn addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a\n\n\nselectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non-\n\n\ntransformants and selectively permitting the growth of the\n\n\ntransformants.\n \nTransformation\n \nis a procedure through which a\n\n\npiece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium (you will study the\n\n\nprocess in subsequent section). Normally, the genes encoding\n\n\nresistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol,\n\n\ntetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable\n\n\nmarkers for\n \nE. coli.\n \nThe normal\n \nE. coli\n \ncells do not carry resistance\n\n\nagainst any of these antibiotics.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nCloning sites:\n \nIn order to link the\n\n\nalien DNA, the vector needs to have\n\n\nvery\n \nfew,\n \npreferably\n \nsingle,\n\n\nrecognition sites\n \nfor the commonly\n\n\nused restriction enzymes. Presence of\n\n\nmore than one recognition sites within\n\n\nthe\n \nvector\n \nwill\n \ngenerate\n \nseveral\n\n\nfragments, which will complicate the\n\n\ngene cloning (Figure 9.4).

Therefore, alternative\n\n\nselectable markers have been developed which differentiate\n\n\nrecombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability\n\n\nto produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In\n\n\nthis, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of\n\n\nan enzyme,\n \nβ\n-galactosidase.\n \nThis results into inactivation of the\n\n\ngene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as\n \ninsertional\n\n\ninactivation\n. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue\n\n\ncoloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an\n\n\ninsert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the\n\n\nβ\n-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour,\n\n\nthese are identified as recombinant colonies.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nVectors for cloning genes in plants and animals :\n \nYou may be\n\n\nsurprised to know that we have learnt the lesson of transferring genes\n\n\ninto plants and animals from bacteria and viruses which have known\n\n\nthis for ages – how to deliver genes to transform eukaryotic cells and\n\n\nforce them to do what the bacteria or viruses want. For example,\n\n\nAgrobacterium tumifaciens\n, a pathogen of several dicot plants is able\n\n\nto deliver a piece of DNA known as ‘T-DNA’ to transform normal\n\n\nplant cells into a\n \ntumor\n \nand direct these tumor cells to produce the\n\n\nchemicals required by the pathogen. Similarly, retroviruses in animals\n\n\nhave the ability to transform normal cells into\n \ncancerous\n \ncells. A\n\n\nbetter understanding of the art of delivering genes by pathogens in\n\n\ntheir eukaryotic hosts has generated knowledge to transform these\n\n\ntools of pathogens into useful vectors for delivering genes of interest\n\n\nto humans. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of\n \nAgrobacterium\n\n\ntumifaciens\n \nhas now been modified into a cloning vector which is no\n\n\nmore pathogenic to the plants but is still able to use the mechanisms\n\n\nto deliver genes of our interest into a variety of plants. Similarly,\n\n\nretroviruses have also been disarmed and are now used to deliver\n\n\ndesirable genes into animal cells. So, once a gene or a DNA fragment\n\n\nhas been ligated into a suitable vector it is transferred into a bacterial,\n\n\nplant or animal host (where it multiplies).\n\n\n9.2.3\n \nCompetent Host (For Transformation with\n\n\nRecombinant DNA)\n\n\nSince DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell\n\n\nmembranes.\n \nWhy\n? In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the\n\n\nbacterial cells must first be made ‘competent’ to take up DNA. This is\n\n\ndone by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation,\n\n\nsuch as calcium, which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters\nRationalised 2023-24","BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n\n171\n\n\nthe bacterium through pores in its cell wall. Recombinant DNA can then\n\n\nbe forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA\n\n\non ice, followed by placing them briefly at 42\n0\nC (heat shock), and then\n\n\nputting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the\n\n\nrecombinant DNA.\n\n\nThis is not the only way to introduce alien DNA into host cells. In a\n\n\nmethod known as\n \nmicro-injection\n, recombinant DNA is directly injected\n\n\ninto the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants,\n\n\ncells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten\n\n\ncoated with DNA in a method known as\n \nbiolistics\n \nor\n \ngene gun\n. And the\n\n\nlast method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to\n\n\ninfect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host.\n\n\nNow that we have learnt about the tools for constructing recombinant\n\n\nDNA, let us discuss the processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n9.3 P\nROCESSES\n \nOF\n \nR\nECOMBINANT\n \nDNA T\nECHNOLOGY\n\n\nRecombinant DNA technology involves several steps in specific\n\n\nsequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by\n\n\nrestriction endonucleases, isolation of a desired DNA fragment,\n\n\nligation of the DNA fragment into a vector, transferring the\n\n\nrecombinant DNA into the host, culturing the host cells in a\n\n\nmedium at large scale and extraction of the desired product.\n\n\nLet us examine each of these steps in some details.\n\n\n9.3.1 Isolation of the Genetic Material (DNA)\n\n\nRecall that nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms\n\n\nwithout\n \nexception.\n \nIn\n \nmajority\n \nof\n \norganisms\n \nthis\n \nis\n\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with\n\n\nrestriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other\n\n\nmacro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the\n\n\nmembranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along\n\n\nwith\n \nother\n \nmacromolecules\n \nsuch\n \nas\n \nRNA,\n \nproteins,\n\n\npolysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating\n\n\nthe bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as\n\n\nlysozyme\n \n(bacteria),\n \ncellulase\n \n(plant cells),\n \nchitinase\n \n(fungus).\n\n\nYou know that genes are located on long molecules of DNA\n\n\ninterwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by\n\n\ntreatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by\n\n\ntreatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate\n\n\ntreatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition\n\n\nof chilled ethanol. This can be seen as collection of fine threads in the\n\n\nsuspension (Figure 9.5).\n\n\nFigure 9.5\n \nDNA that\n\n\nseparates out can be\n\n\nremoved by spooling\nRationalised 2023-24","172\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\n9.3.2 Cutting of DNA at Specific Locations\n\n\nRestriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA\n\n\nmolecules with the restriction enzyme, at the optimal conditions for that\n\n\nspecific enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the\n\n\nprogression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged\n\n\nmolecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode)\n\n\n(Figure 9.3). The process is repeated with the vector DNA also.\n\n\nThe joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the\n\n\nsource DNA as well as the vector DNA with a specific restriction enzyme,\n\n\nthe cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with\n\n\nspace are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of\n\n\nrecombinant DNA.\n\n\n9.3.3 Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR\n\n\nPCR stands for\n \nPolymerase Chain Reaction\n.\n \nIn this reaction, multiple\n\n\ncopies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised\n \nin vitro\n \nusing two\n\n\nFigure 9.6\n \nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) : Each cycle has three steps: (i) Denaturation;\n\n\n(ii) Primer annealing; and (iii) Extension of primers\n\n\n172\nRationalised 2023-24","BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n\n173\n\n\nsets of primers (small chemically synthesised oligonucleotides that are\n\n\ncomplementary to the regions of DNA) and the enzyme DNA polymerase.\n\n\nThe enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the\n\n\nreaction and the genomic DNA as template. If the process of replication\n\n\nof DNA is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified\n\n\nto approximately billion times, i.e., 1 billion copies are made.\n \nSuch\n\n\nrepeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA\n\n\npolymerase (isolated from a bacterium,\n \nThermus aquaticus\n), which\n\n\nremain active during the high temperature induced denaturation of\n\n\ndouble stranded DNA.\n \nThe amplified fragment\n \nif desired can now be\n\n\nused to ligate with a vector for further cloning (Figure 9.6).\n\n\n9.3.4\n \nInsertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host\n\n\nCell/Organism\n\n\nThere are several methods of introducing the ligated DNA into recipient\n\n\ncells. Recipient cells after making them ‘competent’ to receive, take up\n\n\nDNA present in its surrounding. So, if a recombinant DNA bearing gene\n\n\nfor resistance to an antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin) is transferred into\n \nE. coli\n\n\ncells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells. If\n\n\nwe spread the transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only\n\n\ntransformants will grow, untransformed recipient cells will die. Since, due\n\n\nto ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the\n\n\npresence of ampicillin. The ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called\n\n\na\n \nselectable marker\n.\n\n\n9.3.5 Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product\n\n\nWhen you insert a piece of alien DNA into a cloning vector and transfer it\n\n\ninto a bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied. In\n\n\nalmost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a\n\n\ndesirable protein. Hence, there is a need for the recombinant DNA to be\n\n\nexpressed. The foreign gene gets expressed under appropriate conditions.\n\n\nThe expression of foreign genes in host cells involve understanding many\n\n\ntechnical details.\n\n\nAfter having cloned the gene of interest and having optimised the\n\n\nconditions to induce the expression of the target protein, one has to\n\n\nconsider producing it on a large scale.\n \nCan you think of any reason\n\n\nwhy there is a need for large-scale production\n? If any protein encoding\n\n\ngene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a\n \nrecombinant\n\n\nprotein\n. The cells harbouring cloned genes of interest may be grown\n\n\non a small scale in the laboratory. The cultures may be used for\n\n\nextracting the desired protein and then purifying it by using different\n\n\nseparation techniques.\n\n\nThe cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein\n\n\nthe used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is\n\n\nadded from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most\nRationalised 2023-24","174\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nA stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to\n\n\nfacilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even\n\n\nmixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. Alternatively\n\n\nair can be bubbled through the reactor. If you look at the figure closely\n\n\nyou will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery\n\n\nsystem and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH\n\n\ncontrol system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture\n\n\ncan be withdrawn periodically.\n\n\n9.3.6 Downstream Processing\n\n\nAfter completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected\n\n\nthrough a series of processes before it is ready for marketing as a finished\n\n\nactive log/exponential phase. This type of culturing method produces a\n\n\nlarger biomass leading to higher yields of desired protein.\n\n\nSmall volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products.\n\n\nTo produce in large quantities, the development of\n \nbioreactors\n, where\n\n\nlarge volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required.\n\n\nThus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are\n\n\nbiologically converted into specific products,\n \nindividual enzymes, etc.,\n\n\nusing microbial plant, animal or human cells.

Increased yields\n\n\nhave partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly\n\n\ndue to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals\n\n\n(fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world,\n\n\nagrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with\n\n\nexisting varieties are not possible using conventional breeding.\n\n\nAs traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and\n\n\nto provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement,\n\n\nanother technology called\n \ntissue culture\n \ngot developed. What does\n\n\ntissue culture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that\n\n\nwhole plants could be regenerated from\n \nexplants,\n \ni.e., any part of a\n\n\nplant taken out and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in\n\n\nspecial nutrient media. This capacity to generate a whole plant from\n\n\nany cell/explant is called\n \ntotipotency\n.\n \nYou will learn how to accomplish\n\n\nthis in higher classes. It is important to stress here that the nutrient\n\n\nmedium must provide a carbon source such as sucrose and also\n\n\ninorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins,\n\n\ncytokinins etc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve\n\n\npropagation of a large number of plants in very short durations. This\n\n\nmethod of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is\n\n\ncalled\n \nmicro-propagation\n. Each of these plants will be genetically\n\n\nidentical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are\n\n\nsomaclones\n. Many important food plants like tomato, banana, apple,\n\n\netc., have been produced on commercial scale using this method. Try to\n\n\nvisit a tissue culture laboratory with your teacher to better understand\n\n\nand appreciate the process.\n\n\nAnother important application of the method is the recovery of\n\n\nhealthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a\n\n\nvirus, the\n \nmeristem\n \n(apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one\n\n\ncan remove the meristem and grow it\n \nin vitro\n \nto obtain virus-free plants.\n\n\nScientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane,\n\n\npotato, etc.\n\n\nScientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after\n\n\ndigesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts\n\n\n(surrounded by plasma membranes).\n \nIsolated protoplasts from two\n\n\ndifferent varieties of plants – each having a desirable character – can be\n\n\nfused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a\n\n\nnew plant. These hybrids are called\n \nsomatic hybrids\n \nwhile the process\nRationalised 2023-24","179\n\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\n\nis called\n \nsomatic hybridisation\n.

Well,\n\n\nthis has been achieved – resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately\n\n\nthis plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for\n\n\nits commercial utilisation.\n\n\nIs there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can\n\n\nshow so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is\n\n\nthere a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their\n\n\nharmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically\n\n\nmodified crops is a possible solution.\n\n\nPlants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by\n\n\nmanipulation are called\n \nGenetically Modified Organisms\n \n(\nGMO\n).

Bt toxin is produced by a\n\n\nbacterium called\n \nB\nacillus\n \nt\nhuringiensis\n \n(\nBt\n \nfor short). Bt toxin gene has\n\n\nbeen cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide\n\n\nresistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a\n\n\nbio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and\n\n\nsoyabean etc.\n\n\nBt Cotton:\n \nSome strains of\n \nBacillus thuringiensis\n \nproduce proteins that\n\n\nkill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm),\n\n\ncoleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes).\n \nB. thuringiensis\n\n\nforms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These\n\n\ncrystals contain a toxic\n \ninsecticidal protein\n. Why does this toxin not kill\n\n\nthe\n \nBacillus\n? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive\n \nprotoxins\n \nbut\n\n\nonce an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form\n\n\nof toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals.\n\n\nThe activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and\n\n\ncreate pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death\n\n\nof the insect.\nRationalised 2023-24","180\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nSpecific Bt toxin genes were isolated from\n \nBacillus thuringiensis\n \nand\n\n\nincorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 10.1).\n\n\nThe choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as\n\n\nmost Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene\n\n\ncryIAc\n \nnamed\n \ncry\n. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins\n\n\nencoded by the genes\n \ncryIAc\n \nand\n \ncryIIAb\n \ncontrol the cotton bollworms,\n\n\nthat of\n \ncryIAb\n \ncontrols corn borer.\n\n\nPest\n \nResistant Plants\n:\n \nSeveral nematodes parasitise a wide variety of\n\n\nplants and animals including human beings. A nematode\n \nMeloidegyne\n\n\nincognitia\n \ninfects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction\n\n\nin yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which\n\n\nwas based on the process of\n \nRNA interference\n \n(RNAi). RNAi takes place\n\n\nin all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method\n\n\ninvolves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA\n\n\nmolecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing).\n\n\nThe source of this\n \ncomplementary RNA could be from an infection by\n\n\nviruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons)\n\n\nthat replicate via an RNA intermediate.\n\n\nUsing\n \nAgrobacterium\n \nvectors, nematode-specific genes were\n\n\nintroduced into the host plant (Figure 10.2). The introduction of DNA\n\n\nwas such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host\n\n\ncells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double\n\n\nstranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the specific mRNA\n\n\nof the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive\n\n\nin a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic\n\n\nplant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 10.2).\n\n\nFigure 10.1\n \nCotton boll: (a) destroyed by bollworms; (b) a fully mature\n\n\ncotton boll\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n(a)\nRationalised 2023-24","181\n\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\n\n10.2 B\nIOTECHNOLOGICAL\n \nA\nPPLICATIONS\n \nIN\n \nM\nEDICINE\n\n\nThe recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact\n\n\nin the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more\n\n\neffective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not\n\n\ninduce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of\n\n\nsimilar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about\n\n\n30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the\n\n\nworld over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.\n\n\n10.2.1 Genetically Engineered Insulin\n\n\nManagement of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at\n\n\nregular time intervals.\n \nWhat would a diabetic patient do if enough human-\n\n\ninsulin was not available\n? If you discuss this, you would soon realise\n\n\nthat one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals.\n \nWould\n\n\nthe insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that\n\n\nsecreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune\n\n\nresponse in the human body\n?\n \nNow, imagine if bacterium were available\n\n\nthat could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes\n\n\nso simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make\n\n\nas much insulin as you need.\n\n\nThink about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic\n\n\npeople or not. Why?\n\n\nInsulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from pancreas of\n\n\nslaughtered cattle and pigs. Insulin from an animal source, though caused\n\n\nsome patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign\n\n\nprotein. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains: chain A\n\n\nand chain B, that are linked together by disulphide bridges (Figure 10.3).\n\n\nFigure 10.2\n \nHost plant-generated dsRNA triggers protection against nematode infestation:\n\n\n(a) Roots of a typical control plants; (b) transgenic plant roots 5 days after deliberate\n\n\ninfection of nematode but protected through novel mechanism.\n\n\n(a)\n \n(b)\nRationalised 2023-24","182\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nIn mammals, including humans, insulin is synthesised\n\n\nas a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme, the pro-hormone\n\n\nalso needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature\n\n\nand functional hormone) which contains an extra stretch\n\n\ncalled the\n \nC peptide\n. This C peptide is not present in the\n\n\nmature insulin and is removed during maturation into\n\n\ninsulin.The main challenge for production of insulin using\n\n\nrDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a\n\n\nmature form. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company\n\n\nprepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B,\n\n\nchains of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids\n\n\nof\n \nE. coli\n \nto produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were\n\n\nproduced separately, extracted and combined by creating\n\n\ndisulfide bonds to form human insulin.\n\n\n10.2.2 Gene Therapy\n\n\nIf a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy\n\n\nbe taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.\n\n\nGene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a\n\n\ngene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes\n\n\nare\n \ninserted\n \ninto\n \na person’s cells\n \nand\n \ntissues\n \nto\n \ntreat\n \na\n \ndisease.\n\n\nCorrection of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into\n\n\nthe individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate\n\n\nfor the non-functional gene.\n\n\nThe first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl\n\n\nwith adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for\n\n\nthe immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion\n\n\nof the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency\n\n\ncan be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated\n\n\nby enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the\n\n\npatient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that\n\n\nthey are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy,\n\n\nlymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside\n\n\nthe body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then\n\n\nintroduced into these lymphocytes, which are subsequently returned to\n\n\nthe patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires\n\n\nperiodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if\n\n\nthe gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells\n\n\nat early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure.\n\n\n10.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis\n\n\nYou know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and\n\n\nunderstanding its pathophysiology is very important. Using conventional\n\n\nmethods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is\n\n\nFigure 10.3\n \nMaturation of\n\n\npro-insulin into insulin\n\n\n(simplified)\nRationalised 2023-24","183\n\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\n\nnot possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n\n(PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of\n\n\nthe techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis.\n\n\nPresence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected\n\n\nonly when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time\n\n\nthe concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However,\n\n\nvery low concentration of a bacteria or virus (at a time when the symptoms\n\n\nof the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by amplification of their\n\n\nnucleic acid by PCR.\n \nCan you explain how PCR can detect very low\n\n\namounts of DNA?\n \nPCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected\n\n\nAIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected\n\n\ncancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other\n\n\ngenetic disorders.\n\n\nA single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule\n\n\n(probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of\n\n\ncells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the\n\n\nmutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic film, because\n\n\nthe probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.\n\n\nELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.\n\n\nInfection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens\n\n\n(proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised\n\n\nagainst the pathogen.\n\n\n10.3 T\nRANSGENIC\n \nA\nNIMALS\n\n\nAnimals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an\n\n\nextra (foreign) gene are known as\n \ntransgenic animals\n. Transgenic rats,\n\n\nrabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced, although over\n\n\n95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice.\n \nWhy are these\n\n\nanimals being produced? How can man benefit from such modifications\n?\n\n\nLet us try and explore some of the common reasons:\n\n\n(i)\n \nNormal physiology and development:\n \nTransgenic animals can\n\n\nbe specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are\n\n\nregulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body\n\n\nand its development, e.g., study of complex factors involved in growth\n\n\nsuch as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other\n\n\nspecies that alter the formation of this factor and studying the\n\n\nbiological effects that result, information is obtained about the\n\n\nbiological role of the factor in the body.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nStudy of disease:\n \nMany transgenic animals are designed to increase\n\n\nour understanding of how genes contribute to the development of\n\n\ndisease. These are specially made to serve as models for human\n\n\ndiseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made\n\n\npossible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases\n\n\nsuch as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.\nRationalised 2023-24","184\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\n(iii)\n \nBiological products:\n \nMedicines required to treat certain human\n\n\ndiseases can contain biological products, but such products are\n\n\noften expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful\n\n\nbiological products can be created by the introduction of the portion\n\n\nof DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as\n\n\nhuman protein (\nα\n-1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar\n\n\nattempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU)\n\n\nand cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced\n\n\nhuman protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk\n\n\ncontained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a\n\n\nmore balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nVaccine safety:\n \nTransgenic mice are being developed for use in\n\n\ntesting the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans.\n\n\nTransgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine.\n\n\nIf successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of\n\n\nmonkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine.\n\n\n(v)\n \nChemical safety testing:\n \nThis is known as toxicity/safety testing.\n\n\nThe procedure is the same as that used for testing toxicity of drugs.\n\n\nTransgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more\n\n\nsensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals. They are\n\n\nthen exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity\n\n\ntesting in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time.\n\n\n10.4 E\nTHICAL\n \nI\nSSUES\n\n\nThe manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on\n\n\nany further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to\n\n\nevaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living\n\n\norganisms.\n\n\nGoing beyond the morality of such issues, the biological significance\n\n\nof such things is also important. Genetic modification of organisms can\n\n\nhave unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into\n\n\nthe ecosystem.\n\n\nTherefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as\n\n\nGEAC\n \n(Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make\n\n\ndecisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of\n\n\nintroducing GM-organisms for public services.\n\n\nThe modification/usage of living organisms for public services (as food\n\n\nand medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents\n\n\ngranted for the same.\n\n\nThere is growing public anger that certain companies are being\n\n\ngranted patents for products and technologies that make use of the\n\n\ngenetic materials, plants and other biological resources that have long\n\n\nbeen identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people\n\n\nof a specific region/country.\nRationalised 2023-24","185\n\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\n\nRice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back\n\n\nthousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history.

There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and\n\n\npoetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American\n\n\ncompany got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and\n\n\nTrademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of\n\n\nBasmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had\n\n\nactually been derived from Indian farmer’s varieties.

In this\n\n\nchapter we explore ecology at population levels.\n\n\n11.1 P\nOPULATIONS\n\n\n11.1.1 Population Attributes\n\n\nIn nature, we rarely find isolated, single individuals of any species; majority\n\n\nof them live in groups in a well defined geographical area, share or compete\n\n\nfor similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a\n\n\npopulation. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction,\n\n\na group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also\n\n\ngenerally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies.\n\n\nAll the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood\n\n\ntrees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a\n\n\npond, are some examples of a population. In earlier chapters you have\n\n\nlearnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope\n\n\nwith a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural\n\n\nselection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is,\n\n\ntherefore, an important area because it links ecology to population genetics\n\n\nand evolution.\n\n\nA population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism\n\n\ndoes not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has\n\n\nbirth rates\n \nand\n \ndeath\n \nrates\n. In a population these rates refer to\n \nper capita\n\n\nbirths and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers\n\n\n(increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an\n\n\nexample. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through\n\n\nreproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28,\n\n\nwe calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4\n\n\nindividuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitflies died during a specified\n\n\ntime interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period\n\n\nis 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.\n\n\nAnother attribute characteristic of a population is\n \nsex ratio\n. An\n\n\nindividual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio\n\n\n(e.g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males).\n\n\nA population at any given time is composed of individuals of\n\n\ndifferent ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given\n\n\nage or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure\n\n\nis called an age pyramid (Figure 11.1). For human population, the\n\n\nage pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in\n\n\na\n \ndiagram. The shape of the pyramids reflects the growth status of\n\n\nthe population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining.\nRationalised 2023-24","192\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThe size of the population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.\n\n\nWhatever ecological processes we wish to investigate in a population, be\n\n\nit the outcome of competition with another species, the impact of a\n\n\npredator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them\n\n\nin terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could\n\n\nbe as low as <10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or\n\n\ngo into millions (\nChlamydomonas\n \nin a pond). Population size, technically\n\n\ncalled\n \npopulation density\n \n(designated as N), need not necessarily be\n\n\nmeasured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most\n\n\nappropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either\n\n\nmeaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 carrot\n\n\ngrass (\nParthenium hysterophorus\n) plants but only a single huge banyan\n\n\ntree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is\n\n\nlow relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the\n\n\nenormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per\n\n\ncent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population\n\n\nsize. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the\n\n\npopulation is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.\n\n\nIf you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish what is\n\n\nthe best measure to report its density?\n \nSometimes, for certain ecological\n\n\ninvestigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities;\n\n\nrelative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number\n\n\nof fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population\n\n\ndensity in the lake.\n \nWe are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes\n\n\nindirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census\n\n\nin our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and\n\n\nfecal pellets.\n\n\n11.1.2 Population Growth\n\n\nThe size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps\n\n\nchanging with time, depending on various factors including food\n\n\navailability, predation pressure and adverse weather. In fact, it is these\n\n\nchanges in population density that give us some idea of what is happening\n\n\nto the population – whether it is flourishing or declining. Whatever might\n\n\nbe the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat\n\n\nduring a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes,\n\n\nFigure 11.1\n \nRepresentation of age pyramids for human population\nRationalised 2023-24","193\n\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n\ntwo of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in\n\n\npopulation density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.\n\n\n(i)\n \nNatality\n \nrefers to the number of births during a given period in the\n\n\npopulation that are added to the initial density.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nMortality\n \nis the number of deaths in the population during a given\n\n\nperiod.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nImmigration\n \nis the number of individuals of the same species that\n\n\nhave come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period\n\n\nunder consideration.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nEmigration\n \nis the number of individuals of the population who\n\n\nleft the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under\n\n\nconsideration.\n\n\nFigure 11.2\n\n\nSo, if N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t +1 is\n\n\nN\nt+1\n \n= N\nt\n \n+ [(B + I) – (D + E)]\n\n\nYou can see from the above equation (Fig. 11.2) that population\n\n\ndensity will increase if the number of births plus the number of immigrants\n\n\n(B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number of emigrants\n\n\n(D + E).\n \nUnder normal conditions, births and deaths are the most\n\n\nimportant factors influencing population density, the other two factors\n\n\nassuming importance only under special conditions. For instance, if a\n\n\nnew habitat is just being colonised, immigration may contribute more\n\n\nsignificantly to population growth than birth rates.\nRationalised 2023-24","194\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nFigure 11.3\n \nPopulation growth curve\n\n\na\n \nwhen\n \nresponses\n \nare\n \nnot\n\n\nlimiting the growth, plot is\n\n\nexponential,\n\n\nb\n \nwhen responses are limiting\n\n\nthe growth, plot is logistic,\n\n\nK\n \nis carrying capacity\n\n\nGrowth Models\n \n: Does the growth of a population with time show any\n\n\nspecific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about unbridled\n\n\nhuman population growth and problems created by it in our country\n\n\nand it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal\n\n\npopulations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on\n\n\ngrowth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to\n\n\ncontrol population growth.\n\n\n(i)\n \nExponential growth :\n \nResource (food and space) availability is\n\n\nobviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.\n\n\nIdeally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species\n\n\nhas the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number,\n\n\nas Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural selection.\n\n\nThen the population grows in an exponential or geometric fashion.\n\n\nIf in a population of size N, the birth rates (not total number but\n \nper\n\n\ncapita\n \nbirths) are represented as\n \nb\n \nand death rates (again,\n \nper\n \ncapita\n\n\ndeath rates) as\n \nd\n, then the increase or decrease in N during a unit\n\n\ntime period t (dN/dt) will be\n\n\ndN/dt = (b – d) × N\n\n\nLet (b–d) = r, then\n\n\ndN/dt = rN\n\n\nThe r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of\n\n\nnatural increase’ and is a very important parameter\n\n\nchosen for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic\n\n\nfactor on population growth.\n\n\nTo give you some idea about the magnitude of r\n\n\nvalues, for the Norway rat the r is 0.015, and for\n\n\nthe flour beetle it is 0.12. In 1981, the r value for\n\n\nhuman population in India was 0.0205.\n \nFind out\n\n\nwhat the current r value is. For calculating it, you\n\n\nneed to know the birth rates and death rates.\n\n\nThe above equation describes the exponential or\n\n\ngeometric growth pattern of a population (Figure\n\n\n11.3) and results in a J-shaped curve when we plot\n\n\nN in relation to time. If you are familiar with basic\n\n\ncalculus, you can derive the integral form of the\n\n\nexponential growth equation as\n\n\nN\nt\n \n= N\n0\n \ne\nrt\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nN\nt\n \n= Population density after time t\n\n\nN\n0\n \n= Population density at time zero\n\n\nr = intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\n\ne = the base of natural logarithms (2.71828)\n\n\nAny species growing exponentially under unlimited resource\n\n\nconditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.\nRationalised 2023-24","195\n\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n\nDarwin showed how even a slow growing animal like elephant could\n\n\nreach enormous numbers in the absence of checks. The following is\n\n\nan anecdote popularly narrated to demonstrate dramatically how\n\n\nfast a huge population could build up when growing exponentially.\n\n\nThe king and the minister sat for a chess game. The king, confident\n\n\nof winning the game, was ready to accept any bet proposed by the\n\n\nminister. The minister humbly said that if he won, he wanted only\n\n\nsome wheat grains, the quantity of which is to be calculated by\n\n\nplacing on the chess board one grain in Square 1, then two in Square\n\n\n2, then four in Square 3, and eight in Square 4, and so on, doubling\n\n\neach time the previous quantity of wheat on the next square until all the\n\n\n64 squares were filled.\n \nThe king accepted the seemingly silly bet and\n\n\nstarted the game, but unluckily for him, the minister\n \nwon. The king felt that\n\n\nfulfilling the minister’s bet was so easy.\n \nHe started with a single\n\n\ngrain on the first square and proceeded to fill the other squares\n\n\nfollowing minister’s suggested procedure, but by the time he covered\n\n\nhalf the chess board, the king realised to his dismay that all the\n\n\nwheat produced in his entire kingdom pooled together would still be\n\n\ninadequate to cover all the 64 squares. Now think of a tiny\n\n\nParamecium starting with just one individual and through binary\n\n\nfission, doubling in numbers every day, and imagine what a mind-\n\n\nboggling population size it would reach in 64 days. (provided food\n\n\nand space remain unlimited)\n\n\n(ii)\n \nLogistic growth:\n \nNo population of any species in nature has at its\n\n\ndisposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This\n\n\nleads to competition between individuals for limited resources.\n\n\nEventually, the ‘fittest’ individual will survive and reproduce. The\n\n\ngovernments of many countries have also realised this fact and\n\n\nintroduced various restraints with a view to limit human population\n\n\ngrowth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support\n\n\na maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is\n\n\npossible. Let us call this limit as nature’s\n \ncarrying capacity\n \n(K) for\n\n\nthat species in that habitat.\n\n\nA population growing in a habitat with limited resources show\n\n\ninitially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and\n\n\ndeceleration and finally an asymptote, when the population density\n\n\nreaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t)\n\n\nresults in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called\n\n\nVerhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth\n \n(Figure 11.3) and is described by\n\n\nthe following equation:\n\n\ndN/dt =\n \nK\n \nN\n\n\nrN\n \nK\n\n\n−\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nRationalised 2023-24","196\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nWhere\n \nN = Population density at time t\n\n\nr = Intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\n\nK = Carrying capacity\n\n\nSince resources for growth for most animal populations are finite\n\n\nand become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is\n\n\nconsidered a more realistic one.\n\n\nGather from Government Census data the population figures\n\n\nfor India for the last 100 years, plot them and check which growth\n\n\npattern is evident.\n\n\n11.1.3 Life History Variation\n\n\nPopulations evolve to maximise their reproductive\n \nfitness, also called\n\n\nDarwinian fitness (high r value), in the habitat in which they live. Under\n\n\na particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most\n\n\nefficient reproductive strategy. Some organisms breed only once in their\n\n\nlifetime (Pacific salmon fish, bamboo) while others breed many times\n\n\nduring their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large\n\n\nnumber of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic fishes) while others\n\n\nproduce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals). So,\n\n\nwhich is desirable for maximising fitness?\n \nEcologists suggest that life\n\n\nhistory traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints\n\n\nimposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which\n\n\nthey live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an\n\n\nimportant area of research being conducted by ecologists.\n\n\n11.1.4 Population Interactions\n\n\nCan you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a\n\n\nsingle species?\n \nThere is no such habitat and such a situation is even\n\n\ninconceivable.\n \nFor any species, the minimal requirement is one more\n\n\nspecies on which it can feed. Even a plant species, which makes its own\n\n\nfood, cannot survive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic\n\n\nmatter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then,\n\n\nhow will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent?\n \nIt is\n\n\nobvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot\n\n\nlive in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological\n\n\ncommunity.\n \nEven in minimal communities, many interactive linkages\n\n\nexist, although all may not be readily apparent.\n\n\nInterspecific interactions arise from the interaction of populations of\n\n\ntwo different species. They could be beneficial, detrimental or neutral\n\n\n(neither harm nor benefit) to one of the species or both. Assigning a\n \n‘+’\n\n\nsign for beneficial interaction,\n \n‘-’\n \nsign for detrimental and 0 for neutral\n\n\ninteraction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific\n\n\ninteractions (Table11.1).\nRationalised 2023-24","197\n\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n\nBoth the species benefit in\n \nmutualism\n \nand both lose in\n \ncompetition\n \nin\n\n\ntheir interactions with each other. In both\n \nparasitism\n \nand\n \npredation\n \nonly\n\n\none species benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction\n\n\nis detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).\n\n\nThe interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither\n\n\nbenefitted nor harmed is called\n \ncommensalism\n. In\n \namensalism\n \non\n\n\nthe\n \nother\n \nhand\n \none\n \nspecies\n \nis\n \nharmed\n \nwhereas\n \nthe\n \nother\n \nis\n\n\nunaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common\n\n\ncharacteristic– the interacting species live closely together.\n\n\n(i)\n \nPredation\n:\n \nWhat would happen to all the energy fixed by\n\n\nautotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the\n\n\nplants\n? You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring\n\n\nto higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants. When we think\n\n\nof predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that\n\n\nreadily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less\n\n\na predator.\n \nAlthough animals eating plants are categorised\n\n\nseparately as\n \nherbivores\n, they are, in a broad ecological context,\n\n\nnot very different from predators.\n\n\nBesides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic\n\n\nlevels, predators play other important roles.\n \nThey keep prey\n\n\npopulations under control. But for predators, prey species could\n\n\nachieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem\n\n\ninstability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a\n\n\ngeographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast\n\n\nbecause the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The\n\n\nprickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s\n\n\ncaused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of\n\n\nrangeland. Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control\n\n\nonly after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat\n\n\nwas introduced into the country.\n \nBiological control\n \nmethods adopted\n\n\nin agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator\n\n\nSpecies A\n \nSpecies B\n \nName of\n \nInteraction\n\n\n+\n \n+\n \nMutualism\n\n\n–\n \n–\n \nCompetition\n\n\n+\n \n–\n \nPredation\n\n\n+\n \n–\n \nParasitism\n\n\n+\n \n0\n \nCommensalism\n\n\n–\n \n0\n \nAmensalism\n\n\nTable 11.1 : Population Interactions\nRationalised 2023-24","198\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nto regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining\n\n\nspecies diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of\n\n\ncompetition among competing prey species.\n \nIn the rocky intertidal\n\n\ncommunities of the American Pacific Coast the starfish\n \nPisaster\n \nis\n\n\nan important predator. In a field experiment, when all the starfish\n\n\nwere removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species\n\n\nof invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter-\n\n\nspecific competition.\n\n\nIf a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the\n\n\nprey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also\n\n\nbecome extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in\n\n\nnature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to\n\n\nlessen the impact of predation. Some species of insects and frogs\n\n\nare cryptically-coloured (\ncamouflaged\n) to avoid being detected easily\n\n\nby the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the\n\n\npredators. The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator\n\n\n(bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.\n\n\nInterestingly, the butterfly acquires this chemical during its\n\n\ncaterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.\n\n\nFor plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of\n\n\nall insects are known to be\n \nphytophagous\n \n(feeding on plant sap\n\n\nand other parts of plants). The problem is particularly severe for\n\n\nplants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their\n\n\npredators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of\n\n\nmorphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns\n\n\n(\nAcacia\n,\n \nCactus\n) are the most common morphological means of\n\n\ndefence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the\n\n\nherbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion,\n\n\ndisrupt its reproduction or even kill it.\n \nYou must have seen the\n\n\nweed\n \nCalotropis\n \ngrowing in abandoned fields. The plant produces\n\n\nhighly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see\n\n\nany cattle or goats browsing on this plant. A wide variety of chemical\n\n\nsubstances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale\n\n\n(nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced\n\n\nby them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nCompetition\n:\n \nWhen Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and\n\n\nsurvival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific\n\n\ncompetition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally\n\n\nbelieved that competition occurs when closely related species\n\n\ncompete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not\n\n\nentirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete\n\n\nfor the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South\n\n\nAmerican lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for\n\n\ntheir common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly,\nRationalised 2023-24","199\n\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n\nresources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in\n\n\ninterference competition, the feeding efficiency of one species might\n\n\nbe reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the\n\n\nother species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant.\n\n\nTherefore, competition is best defined as a process in which the\n\n\nfitness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate\n\n\nof increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another species.\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as\n\n\nGause and other experimental ecologists did, when resources are\n\n\nlimited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate\n\n\nthe other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion\n\n\noccurring in nature is not always conclusive. Strong and persuasive\n\n\ncircumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases. The\n\n\nAbingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a\n\n\ndecade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due\n\n\nto the greater browsing efficiency of the goats. Another evidence for\n\n\nthe occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called\n\n\n‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a\n\n\nsmall geographical area because of the presence of a competitively\n\n\nsuperior species, is found to expand its distributional range\n\n\ndramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.\n\n\nConnell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea\n\n\ncoasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle\n\n\nBalanus\n \ndominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller\n\n\nbarnacle\n \nChathamalus\n \nfrom that zone. In general, herbivores and\n\n\nplants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than\n\n\ncarnivores.\n\n\nGause’s ‘\nCompetitive\n \nExclusion\n \nPrinciple’\n \nstates that two closely\n\n\nrelated species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist\n\n\nindefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated\n\n\neventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not\n\n\notherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross\n\n\ngeneralisations about competition. While they do not rule out the\n\n\noccurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out\n\n\nthat species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that\n\n\npromote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism\n\n\nis ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same\n\n\nresource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance,\n\n\ndifferent times for\n \nfeeding or different foraging patterns. MacArthur\n\n\nshowed that five closely related species of warblers living on the\n\n\nsame tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to\n\n\nbehavioural differences in their foraging activities.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nParasitism\n:\n \nConsidering that the parasitic mode of life ensures\n\n\nfree lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has\nRationalised 2023-24","200\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nevolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher\n\n\nvertebrates. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they\n\n\ncan parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that\n\n\nboth host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host\n\n\nevolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite,\n\n\nthe parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise\n\n\nthem, in order to be successful with the same host species. In\n\n\naccordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special\n\n\nadaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence\n\n\nof adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of\n\n\ndigestive system and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of\n\n\nparasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts\n\n\nor vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human\n\n\nliver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate\n\n\nhosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle. The malarial\n\n\nparasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.\n\n\nMajority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the\n\n\nsurvival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its\n\n\npopulation density. They might render the host more vulnerable\n\n\nto predation by making it physically weak.\n \nDo you believe that\n\n\nan ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without\n\n\nharming it? Then why didn’t natural selection lead to the\n\n\nevolution of such totally harmless parasites\n?\n\n\nParasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism\n\n\nare called\n \nectoparasites\n. The most familiar examples of this group\n\n\nare the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are\n\n\ninfested with ectoparasitic copepods.\n \nCuscuta\n, a parasitic plant\n\n\nthat is commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its\n\n\nchlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution.

Plants need\n\n\nthe help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their\n\n\nseeds. Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that\n\n\nplants expect from them. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of\n\n\npollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for\n\n\nseed dispersers.\n \nBut the mutually beneficial system should also\n\n\nbe safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to\n\n\nsteal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why\n\n\nplant-animal interactions often involve\n \nco-evolution\n \nof the\n\n\nmutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator\n\n\nspecies are tightly linked with one another. In many species of fig\n\n\ntrees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator\n\n\nspecies of wasp (Figure 11.4). It means that a given fig species can\n\n\nbe pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species.\n\n\nThe female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying)\n\n\nsite but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing\n\n\nits larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while\n\n\nsearching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the\n\n\nfavour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its\n\n\ndeveloping seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.\n\n\nOrchids show a bewildering diversity of floral\n\n\npatterns many of which have evolved to attract the right\n\n\npollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure\n\n\nguaranteed pollination by it (Figure 11.5). Not all\n\n\norchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid\n \nOphrys\n\n\nemploys ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done by a\n\n\nspecies of bee. One petal of its flower bears an uncanny\n\n\nresemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and\n\n\nmarkings. The male bee is attracted to what it perceives\n\n\nas a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the flower, and\n\n\nduring that process is dusted with pollen from the\n\n\nflower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’ with\n\n\nanother flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus,\n\n\npollinates the flower. Here you can see how co-evolution\n\n\noperates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any\n\n\nreason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the\n\n\norchid flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the\n\n\nfemale bee.\n\n\nFigure 11.5\n \nShowing bee-a pollinator\n\n\non orchid flower\nRationalised 2023-24","203\n\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAs a branch of biology, Ecology is the study of the relationships of\n\n\nliving organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic\n\n\ncomponents (other species) of their environment. It is concerned\n\n\nwith four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations,\n\n\ncommunities and biomes.\n\n\nEvolutionary changes through natural selection take place at\n\n\nthe population level and hence, population ecology is an important\n\n\narea of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given\n\n\nspecies sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined\n\n\ngeographical area. Populations have attributes that individual\n\n\norganisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age\n\n\ndistribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and\n\n\nfemales in a population is often presented graphically as age\n\n\npyramid; its shape indicates whether a population is stationary,\n\n\ngrowing or declining.\n\n\nEcological effects of any factors on a population are generally\n\n\nreflected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in\n\n\ndifferent ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending\n\n\non the species.\n\n\nPopulations grow through births and immigration and decline\n\n\nthrough deaths and emigration.\n \nWhen resources are unlimited,\n\n\nthe growth is usually exponential but when resources become\n\n\nprogressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either\n\n\ncase, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the\n\n\nenvironment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (\nr\n) is a measure\n\n\nof the inherent potential of a population to grow.\n\n\nIn nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live\n\n\nin isolation but interact in many ways.\n \nDepending on the outcome,\n\n\nthese interactions between two species are classified as competition\n\n\n(both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one benefits and\n\n\nthe other suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is\n\n\nunaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and\n\n\nmutualism (both species benefit).\n \nPredation is a very important\n\n\nprocess through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and\n\n\nsome predators help in controlling their prey populations.

Many ecologists regard the entire\n\n\nbiosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all\n\n\nlocal ecosystems on Earth. Since this system is too much\n\n\nbig and complex to be studied at one time, it is convenient\n\n\nto divide it into two basic categories, namely the\n\n\nterrestrial\n \nand the\n \naquatic\n. Forest, grassland and desert\n\n\nare some examples of terrestrial ecosystems; pond, lake,\n\n\nwetland, river and estuary are some examples of aquatic\n\n\necosystems.

You studied how the individual biotic\n\n\nand abiotic factors affected each other and their surrounding. Let us look\n\n\nat these components in a more integrated manner and see how the flow of\n\n\nenergy takes place within these components of the ecosystem.\n\n\nInteraction of biotic and abiotic components result in a physical\n\n\nstructure that is characteristic for each type of ecosystem. Identification\n\n\nand enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its\n\n\nspecies composition. Vertical distribution of different species occupying\n\n\ndifferent levels is called\n \nstratification\n. For example, trees occupy top\n\n\nvertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses\n\n\noccupy the bottom layers.\n\n\nThe components of the ecosystem are seen to function as a unit when\n\n\nyou consider the following aspects:\n\n\n(i) Productivity;\n\n\n(ii) Decomposition;\n\n\n(iii) Energy flow; and\n\n\n(iv) Nutrient cycling.\n\n\nTo understand the ethos of an aquatic ecosystem let us take a small\n\n\npond as an example. This is fairly a self-sustainable unit and rather simple\n\n\nexample that explain even the complex interactions that exist in an aquatic\n\n\necosystem. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the above\n\n\nmentioned four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.\n\n\nThe abiotic component is the water with all the dissolved inorganic and\n\n\norganic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the pond.\n\n\nThe solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic\n\n\nconditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond. The autotrophic\n\n\ncomponents include the phytoplankton, some algae and the floating,\n\n\nsubmerged and marginal plants found at the edges. The consumers are\n\n\nrepresented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling\n\n\nforms. The decomposers are the fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially\n\n\nabundant in the bottom of the pond. This system performs all the functions\n\n\nof any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole, i.e., conversion of\n\n\ninorganic into organic material with the help of the radiant energy of the\n\n\nsun by the autotrophs; consumption of the autotrophs by heterotrophs;\n\n\ndecomposition and mineralisation of the dead matter to release them back\n\n\nfor reuse by the autotrophs, these event are repeated over and over again.\n\n\nThere is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic\n\n\nlevels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.\n\n\n12.2 P\nRODUCTIVITY\n\n\nA constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem\n\n\nto function and sustain.\n \nPrimary\n \nproduction\n \nis defined as the amount of\nRationalised 2023-24","207\n\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n\nbiomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by\n\n\nplants during photosynthesis.

The annual net primary\n\n\nproductivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons\n\n\n(dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per\n\n\ncent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.\n\n\nRest of course, is on land.\n \nDiscuss the main reason for the low\n\n\nproductivity of ocean with your teacher.\n\n\n12.3 D\nECOMPOSITION\n\n\nYou may have heard of the earthworm being referred to as the farmer’s\n\n\n‘friend’. This is so because they help in the breakdown of complex organic\n\n\nmatter as well as in loosening of the soil. Similarly, decomposers break\n\n\ndown complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon\n\n\ndioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called\n \ndecomposition\n.\n\n\nDead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of\n\n\nanimals, including fecal matter, constitute\n \ndetritus\n, which is the raw\n\n\nmaterial for decomposition. The important steps in the process of\n\n\ndecomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and\n\n\nmineralisation.\n\n\nDetritivores\n \n(e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles.\n\n\nThis process is called\n \nfragmentation.\n \nBy the process of\n \nleaching,\n \nwater-\n\n\nsoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated\n\n\nas unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into\n\n\nsimpler inorganic substances. This process is called as\n \ncatabolism\n.\n\n\nIt is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition operate\n\n\nsimultaneously on the detritus (Figure 12.1). Humification and\n\n\nmineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil.\n \nHumification\n \nleads\nRationalised 2023-24","208\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nto accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called\n \nhumus\n\n\nthat is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition\n\n\nat an extremely slow rate.

The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release\n\n\nof inorganic nutrients occur by the process known as\n \nmineralisation\n.\n\n\nDecomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of\n\n\ndecomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and\n\n\nclimatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate\n\n\nis slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is\n\n\nrich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature\n\n\nand soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate\n\n\ndecomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.\n\n\nWarm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low\n\n\ntemperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build\n\n\nup of organic materials.\n\n\nFigure 12.1\n \nDiagrammatic representation of decomposition cycle in a terrestrial ecosystem\nRationalised 2023-24","209\n\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n\n12.4 E\nNERGY\n \nF\nLOW\n\n\nExcept for the deep sea hydro-thermal ecosystem, sun is the only source\n\n\nof energy for all ecosystems on Earth. Of the incident solar radiation less\n\n\nthan 50 per cent of it is\n \nphotosynthetically active radiation\n \n(PAR). We\n\n\nknow that plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs), fix Sun’s\n\n\nradiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials. Plants\n\n\ncapture only 2-10 per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy\n\n\nsustains the entire living world. So, it is very important to know how the\n\n\nsolar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an\n\n\necosystem. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers, either\n\n\ndirectly or indirectly. So you find unidirectional flow of energy from the\n\n\nsun to producers and then to consumers.\n \nIs this in keeping with the first\n\n\nlaw of thermodynamics?\n\n\nFurther, ecosystems are not exempt from the Second Law of\n\n\nthermodynamics. They need a constant supply of energy to synthesise\n\n\nthe molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency toward\n\n\nincreasing disorderliness.\n\n\nThe green plant in the ecosystem are called\n \nproducers\n. In a terrestrial\n\n\necosystem, major producers are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,\n\n\nproducers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton,\n\n\nalgae and higher plants.\n\n\nYou have read about the food chains and webs that exist in nature.\n\n\nStarting from the plants (or producers) food chains or rather webs are\n\n\nformed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in\n\n\nturn is food for another. The chain or web is formed because of this\n\n\ninterdependency. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in\n\n\nit for ever. The energy trapped by the producer, hence, is either passed on\n\n\nto a consumer or the organism dies. Death of organism is the beginning\n\n\nof the detritus food chain/web.\n\n\nAll animals depend on plants (directly or indirectly) for their food needs.\n\n\nThey are hence called\n \nconsumers\n \nand also heterotrophs. If they feed on\n\n\nthe producers, the plants, they are called primary consumers, and if the\n\n\nanimals eat other animals which in turn eat the plants (or their produce)\n\n\nthey are called secondary consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary\n\n\nconsumers too.\n \nObviously the primary consumers will be\n \nherbivores\n.\n\n\nSome common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial\n\n\necosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.\n\n\nThe consumers that feed on these herbivores are carnivores, or more\n\n\ncorrectly\n \nprimary carnivores\n \n(though secondary consumers). Those\n\n\nanimals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled\n\n\nsecondary carnivores.\n \nA simple grazing food chain (GFC) is depicted\n\n\nbelow:\n\n\nGrass\n \nGoat\n \nMan\n\n\n(Producer)\n \n(Primary Consumer)\n \n(Secondary consumer)\nRationalised 2023-24","210\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nThe\n \ndetritus food chain\n \n(DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is\n\n\nmade up of\n \ndecomposers\n \nwhich are heterotrophic organisms, mainly\n\n\nfungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by\n\n\ndegrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as\n\n\nsaprotrophs\n \n(\nsapro:\n \nto decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive\n\n\nenzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic\n\n\nmaterials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.\n\n\nIn an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.\n\n\nAs against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy\n\n\nflows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus\n\n\nfood chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:\n\n\nsome of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural\n\n\necosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.\n\n\nThese natural interconnection of food chains make it a\n \nfood web\n.\n \nHow\n\n\nwould you classify human beings!\n\n\nOrganisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a\n\n\ncommunity according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.\n\n\nBased on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific\n\n\nplace in the food chain that is known as their\n \ntrophic level\n. Producers\n\n\nbelong to the first trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer) to the\n\n\nsecond and carnivores (secondary consumer) to the third (Figure 12.2).\n\n\nFigure 12.2\n \nDiagrammatic representation of trophic levels in an ecosystem\n\n\n210\nRationalised 2023-24","211\n\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n\nFigure 12.3\n \nEnergy flow through different trophic levels\n\n\n211\n\n\nThe important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at\n\n\nsuccessive trophic levels.\n \nWhen any organism dies it is converted to\n\n\ndetritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.\n\n\nOrganisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level\n\n\nfor their energy demands.\n\n\nEach trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular\n\n\ntime called as the\n \nstanding crop\n. The standing crop is measured as the\n\n\nmass of living organisms (\nbiomass)\n \nor the number in a unit area. The\n\n\nbiomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight.\n\n\nMeasurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate.\n \nWhy?\n\n\nThe number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as\n\n\nthe transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the\n\n\nenergy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level. In\n\n\nnature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary\n\n\ncarnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain (Figure 12.3) .\n\n\nDo you think there is any such limitation in a detritus food chain?\n\n\n12.5 E\nCOLOGICAL\n \nP\nYRAMIDS\n\n\nYou must be familiar with the shape of a pyramid.

Abiotic components are\n\n\ninorganic materials- air, water and soil, whereas biotic components\n\n\nare producers, consumers and decomposers. Each ecosystem has\n\n\ncharacteristic physical structure resulting from interaction amongst\n\n\nabiotic and biotic components. Species composition and stratification\n\n\nare the two main structural features of an ecosystem. Based on source\n\n\nof nutrition every organism occupies a place in an ecosystem.\n\n\nProductivity, decomposition, energy flow, and nutrient cycling are\n\n\nthe four important components of an ecosystem. Primary productivity\n\n\nis the rate of capture of solar energy or biomass production of the\n\n\nproducers. It is divided into two types: gross primary productivity (GPP)\n\n\nand net primary productivity (NPP). Rate of capture of solar energy or\n\n\ntotal production of organic matter is called as GPP. NPP is the remaining\n\n\nbiomass or the energy left after utilisation of producers. Secondary\n\n\nproductivity is the rate of assimilation of food energy by the consumers.\n\n\nIn decomposition, complex organic compounds of detritus are converted\n\n\nto carbon dioxide, water and inorganic nutrients by the decomposers.\n\n\nDecomposition involves three processes, namely fragmentation of\n\n\ndetritus, leaching and catabolism.\n\n\nEnergy flow is unidirectional. First, plants capture solar energy\n\n\nand then, food is transferred from the producers to decomposers.\n\n\nOrganisms of different trophic levels in nature are connected to each\n\n\nother for food or energy relationship forming a food chain. The storage\n\n\nand movement of nutrient elements through the various components\n\n\nof the ecosystem is called nutrient cycling; nutrients are repeatedly\n\n\nused through this process. Nutrient cycling is of two types—gaseous\n\n\nand sedimentary. Atmosphere or hydrosphere is the reservoir for the\n\n\ngaseous type of cycle (carbon), whereas Earth’s crust is the reservoir\n\n\nfor sedimentary type (phosphorus). Products of ecosystem processes\n\n\nare named as ecosystem services, e.g., purification of air and water by\n\n\nforests.\n\n\nEXERCISES\n\n\n1.\n \nFill in the blanks.\n\n\n(a)\n \nPlants are called as_________because they fix carbon dioxide.\n\n\n(b)\n \nIn an ecosystem dominated by trees, the pyramid (of numbers)\n\n\nis_________type.\n\n\nHowever, there are certain limitations of ecological pyramids such as\n\n\nit does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more\n\n\ntrophic levels.

Biodiversity and\n\n\nits conservation are now vital environmental issues of international concern\n\n\nas more and more people around the world begin to realise the critical\n\n\nimportance of biodiversity for our survival and well- being on this planet.\n\n\n13.1.1 How Many Species are there on Earth and How Many\n\n\nin India?\n\n\nSince there are published records of all the species discovered and named,\n\n\nwe know how many species in all have been recorded so far, but it is not\n\n\neasy to answer the question of how many species there are on earth.\n\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and\n\n\nNatural Resources (IUCN) (2004), the total number of plant and animal\n\n\nspecies described so far is slightly more than 1.5 million, but we have no\n\n\nclear idea of how many species are yet to be discovered and described.\n\n\nEstimates vary widely and many of them are only educated guesses. For\n\n\nmany taxonomic groups, species inventories are more complete in\n\n\ntemperate than in tropical countries. Considering that an overwhelmingly\n\n\nlarge proportion of the species waiting to be discovered are in the tropics,\n\n\nbiologists make a statistical comparison of the temperate-tropical species\n\n\nrichness of an exhaustively studied group of insects and extrapolate this\n\n\nratio to other groups of animals and plants to come up with a gross\n\n\nestimate of the total number of species on earth. Some extreme estimates\n\n\nrange from 20 to 50 million, but a more conservative and scientifically\n\n\nsound estimate made by Robert May places the global species diversity\n\n\nat about 7 million.\nRationalised 2023-24","218\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nLet us look at some interesting aspects about earth’s biodiversity based\n\n\non the currently available species inventories. More than 70 per cent of\n\n\nall the species recorded are animals, while plants (including algae, fungi,\n\n\nbryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) comprise no more than 22\n\n\nper cent of the total. Among animals, insects are the most species-rich\n\n\ntaxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That\n\n\nmeans, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects. Again, how\n\n\ndo we explain this enormous diversification of insects? The number of\n\n\nfungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species\n\n\nof fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In Figure 13.1, biodiversity\n\n\nis depicted showing species number of major taxa.\n\n\nFigure 13.1\n \nRepresenting global biodiversity: proportionate number of\n\n\nspecies of major taxa of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates\n\n\nIt should be noted that these estimates do not give any figures for\n\n\nprokaryotes. Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species\n\n\nthere might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are\n\n\nnot suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply\n\n\nnot culturable under laboratory conditions. If we accept biochemical or\n\n\nmolecular criteria for delineating species for this group, then their diversity\n\n\nalone might run into millions.\nRationalised 2023-24","219\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\n\nAlthough India has only 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, its share\n\n\nof the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent. That is what\n\n\nmakes our country one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.\n\n\nNearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many of animals have been\n\n\nrecorded from India. How many living species are actually there waiting\n\n\nto be discovered and named? If we accept May’s global estimates, only\n\n\n22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far. Applying this\n\n\nproportion to India’s diversity figures, we estimate that there are probably\n\n\nmore than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species\n\n\nyet to be discovered and described.\n \nWould we ever be able to complete\n\n\nthe inventory of the biological wealth of our country? Consider the immense\n\n\ntrained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the\n\n\njob. The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large\n\n\nfraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before\n\n\nwe discover them. Nature’s biological library is burning even before we\n\n\ncatalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.\n\n\n13.1.2 Patterns of Biodiversity\n\n\n(i)\n \nLatitudinal gradients\n \n:\n \nThe diversity of plants and animals is\n\n\nnot uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven\n\n\ndistribution. For many group of animals or plants, there are\n\n\ninteresting patterns in diversity, the most well- known being the\n\n\nlatitudinal gradient in diversity. In general, species diversity\n\n\ndecreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.\n\n\nWith very few exceptions, tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5° N to\n\n\n23.5° S) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.\n\n\nColombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds\n\n\nwhile New York at 41° N has 105 species and Greenland at 71° N\n\n\nonly 56 species. India, with much of its land area in the tropical\n\n\nlatitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds. A forest in a tropical\n\n\nregion like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular\n\n\nplants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest\n\n\nof the USA.\n \nThe largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South\n\n\nAmerica has the greatest biodiversity on earth- it is home to more\n\n\nthan 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427\n\n\nof mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than\n\n\n1,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests\n\n\nthere might be at least two million insect species waiting to be\n\n\ndiscovered and named.\n\n\nWhat is so special about tropics that might account for their greater\n\n\nbiological diversity?\n \nEcologists and evolutionary biologists have\n\n\nproposed various hypotheses; some important ones are (a) Speciation\n\n\nis generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected\n\n\nto frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained\n\n\nrelatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long\nRationalised 2023-24","220\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nevolutionary time for species diversification, (b) Tropical environments,\n\n\nunlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant\n\n\nand predictable. Such constant environments promote niche\n\n\nspecialisation and lead to a greater species diversity and (c) There\n\n\nis more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to\n\n\nhigher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater\n\n\ndiversity.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nSpecies-Area relationships\n \n:\n \nDuring his pioneering and extensive\n\n\nexplorations in the wilderness of South American jungles, the great\n\n\nGerman naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt\n\n\nobserved that within a region species\n\n\nrichness increased with increasing\n\n\nexplored area, but only up to a limit. In\n\n\nfact, the relation between species richness\n\n\nand area for a wide variety of taxa\n\n\n(angiosperm\n \nplants,\n \nbirds,\n \nbats,\n\n\nfreshwater fishes) turns out to be a\n\n\nrectangular hyperbola (Figure13.2). On\n\n\na logarithmic scale, the relationship is a\n\n\nstraight line described by the equation\n\n\nlog S = log C + Z log A\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nS= Species richness\n \nA= Area\n\n\nZ = slope of the line (regression\n\n\ncoefficient)\n\n\nC = Y-intercept\n\n\nEcologists have discovered that the\n\n\nvalue of Z lies in the range of 0.1 to 0.2,\n\n\nregardless of the taxonomic group or the\n\n\nregion (whether it is the plants in Britain,\n\n\nbirds in California or molluscs in New York state, the slopes of the regression\n\n\nline are amazingly similar).\n \nBut, if you analyse the species-area\n\n\nrelationships among very large areas like the entire continents, you will\n\n\nfind that the slope of the line to be much steeper (Z values in the range\n\n\nof 0.6 to 1.2).\n \nFor example, for frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and\n\n\nmammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found\n\n\nto be 1.15.\n \nWhat do steeper slopes mean in this context?\n\n\n13.1.3 The importance of Species Diversity to the Ecosystem\n\n\nDoes the number of species in a community really matter to the functioning\n\n\nof the ecosystem?This is a question for which ecologists have not been\n\n\nable to give a definitive answer.\n \nFor many decades, ecologists believed\n\n\nthat communities with more species, generally, tend to be more stable\n\n\nthan those with less species.\n \nWhat exactly is stability for a biological\n\n\nFigure 13.2\n \nShowing\n \nspecies\n \narea\n \nrelationship.\n\n\nNote that on log scale the relationship\n\n\nbecomes linear\nRationalised 2023-24","221\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\n\ncommunity?\n \nA stable community should not show too much variation\n\n\nin productivity from year to year; it must be either resistant or resilient to\n\n\noccasional disturbances (natural or man-made), and it must also be\n\n\nresistant to invasions by alien species. We don’t know how these attributes\n\n\nare linked to species richness in a community, but David Tilman’s\n\n\nlong-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots provide some\n\n\ntentative answers.\n \nTilman found that plots with more species showed\n\n\nless year-to-year variation in total biomass. He also showed that in his\n\n\nexperiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.\n\n\nAlthough, we may not understand completely how species richness\n\n\ncontributes to the well-being of an ecosystem, we know enough to realise\n\n\nthat\n \nrich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but\n\n\nimperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet.\n \nAt a\n\n\ntime when we are losing species at an alarming pace,\n \none might ask–\n\n\nDoes it really matter to us if a few species become extinct? Would Western\n\n\nGhats ecosystems be less functional if one of its tree frog species is lost\n\n\nforever? How is our quality of life affected if, say, instead of 20,000 we\n\n\nhave only 15,000 species of ants on earth?\n\n\nThere are no direct answers to such näive questions but we can develop\n\n\na proper perspective through an analogy (the ‘rivet popper hypothesis’)\n\n\nused by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich. In an airplane (ecosystem) all\n\n\nparts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species).\n \nIf every\n\n\npassenger travelling in it starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a\n\n\nspecies to become extinct), it may not affect flight safety (proper functioning\n\n\nof the ecosystem) initially, but as more and more rivets are removed, the\n\n\nplane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.\n \nFurthermore,\n\n\nwhich rivet is removed may also be critical. Loss of rivets on the wings\n\n\n(key species that drive major ecosystem functions) is obviously a more\n\n\nserious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or\n\n\nwindows inside the plane.\n\n\n13.1.4 Loss of Biodiversity\n\n\nWhile it is doubtful if any new species are being added (through speciation)\n\n\ninto the earth’s treasury of species, there is no doubt about their continuing\n\n\nlosses.\n \nThe biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly\n\n\nand the accusing finger is clearly pointing to human activities. The\n\n\ncolonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by humans is said to have led to\n\n\nthe extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds. The IUCN Red\n\n\nList (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338\n\n\nvertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years. Some\n\n\nexamples of recent extinctions include the dodo (Mauritius), quagga\n\n\n(Africa), thylacine (Australia), Steller’s Sea Cow (Russia) and three\n\n\nsubspecies (Bali, Javan, Caspian) of tiger.\n \nThe last twenty years alone\n\n\nhave witnessed the disappearance of 27 species. Careful analysis of records\nRationalised 2023-24","222\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\nshows that extinctions across taxa are not random; some groups like\n\n\namphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction. Adding to the\n\n\ngrim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species\n\n\nworld-wide are facing the threat of extinction. Presently, 12 per cent of\n\n\nall bird species, 23 per cent of all mammal species, 32 per cent of all\n\n\namphibian species and 31per cent of all gymnosperm species in the world\n\n\nface the threat of extinction.\n\n\nFrom a study of the history of life on earth through fossil records, we\n\n\nlearn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently\n\n\nwitnessing have also happened earlier, even before humans appeared on\n\n\nthe scene. During the long period (> 3 billion years) since the origin and\n\n\ndiversification of life on earth there were five episodes of mass extinction\n\n\nof species. How is the ‘Sixth Extinction’ presently in progress different\n\n\nfrom the previous episodes? The difference is in the rates; the current\n\n\nspecies extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster\n\n\nthan in the pre-human times and our activities are responsible for the\n\n\nfaster rates. Ecologists warn that if the present trends continue,\n\n\nnearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next\n\n\n100 years.\n\n\nIn general, loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to (a) decline in\n\n\nplant production, (b) lowered resistance to environmental perturbations\n\n\nsuch as drought and (c) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes\n\n\nsuch as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.\n\n\nCauses of biodiversity losses:\n \nThe accelerated rates of species\n\n\nextinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human\n\n\nactivities. There are four major causes (‘ The Evil Quartet ’ is the sobriquet\n\n\nused to describe them).\n\n\n(i)\n \nHabitat loss and fragmentation\n:\n \nThis is the most important\n\n\ncause driving animals and plants to extinction. The most dramatic\n\n\nexamples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once\n\n\ncovering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these\n\n\nrain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent.\n \nThey are being\n\n\ndestroyed fast. By the time you finish reading this chapter, 1000\n\n\nmore hectares of rain forest would have been lost.\n \nThe Amazon\n\n\nrain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’)\n\n\nharbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared\n\n\nfor cultivating\n \nsoya beans\n \nor for conversion to grasslands for raising\n\n\nbeef cattle. Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by\n\n\npollution also threatens the survival of many species. When large\n\n\nhabitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human\n\n\nactivities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain\n\n\nanimals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to\n\n\npopulation declines.\n\n\n(ii)\n \nOver-exploitation\n:\n \nHumans have always depended on nature for\n\n\nfood and shelter, but when ‘need’ turns to ‘greed’, it leads to\nRationalised 2023-24","223\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\n\nover -exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions\n\n\nin the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due\n\n\nto overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish\n\n\npopulations around the world are over harvested, endangering the\n\n\ncontinued existence of some commercially important species.\n\n\n(iii)\n \nAlien species invasions\n:\n \nWhen alien species are introduced\n\n\nunintentionally or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them\n\n\nturn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.\n\n\nThe Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led\n\n\neventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of\n\n\nmore than 200 species of cichlid fish in the lake. You must be\n\n\nfamiliar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed\n\n\nto our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass\n\n\n(\nParthenium\n)\n,\n \nLantana\n \nand water hyacinth (\nEicchornia\n)\n.\n \nThe recent\n\n\nillegal introduction of the African catfish\n \nClarias gariepinus\n \nfor\n\n\naquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes\n\n\nin our rivers.\n\n\n(iv)\n \nCo-extinctions\n:\n \nWhen a species becomes extinct, the plant and\n\n\nanimal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become\n\n\nextinct. When a host fish species becomes extinct, its unique\n\n\nassemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example\n\n\nis the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where\n\n\nextinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.\n\n\n13.2 B\nIODIVERSITY\n \nC\nONSERVATION\n\n\n13.2.1 Why Should We Conserve Biodiversity?\n\n\nThere are many reasons, some obvious and others not so obvious, but all\n\n\nequally important. They can be grouped into three categories: narrowly\n\n\nutilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.\n\n\nThe\n \nnarrowly utilitarian\n \narguments for conserving biodiversity are\n\n\nobvious; humans derive countless direct economic benefits from nature-\n\n\nfood (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fibre, construction material,\n\n\nindustrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes ) and\n\n\nproducts of medicinal importance.\n \nMore than 25 per cent of the drugs\n\n\ncurrently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants and 25,000\n\n\nspecies of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native\n\n\npeoples around the world. Nobody knows how many more medicinally\n\n\nuseful plants there are in tropical rain forests waiting to be explored.\n\n\nWith increasing resources put into ‘bioprospecting’ (exploring molecular,\n\n\ngenetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance),\n\n\nnations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous\n\n\nbenefits.\n\n\nThe\n \nbroadly utilitarian\n \nargument says that biodiversity plays a\n\n\nmajor role in many ecosystem services that nature provides.\n \nThe fast-\nRationalised 2023-24","224\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ndwindling\n \nAmazon\n \nforest\n \nis\n \nestimated\n \nto\n \nproduce,\n \nthrough\n\n\nphotosynthesis, 20 per cent of the total oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\n\nCan we put an economic value on this service by nature? You can get\n\n\nsome idea by finding out how much your neighborhood hospital spends\n\n\non a cylinder of oxygen.\n \nPollination (without which plants cannot give\n\n\nus fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through\n\n\npollinators layer – bees, bumblebees, birds and bats.\n \nWhat will be the\n\n\ncosts\n \nof\n \naccomplishing\n \npollination\n \nwithout\n \nhelp\n \nfrom\n \nnatural\n\n\npollinators?\n \nThere are other intangible benefits – that we derive from\n\n\nnature–the aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching\n\n\nspring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul’s song in the\n\n\nmorning. Can we put a price tag on such things?\n\n\nThe\n \nethical\n \nargument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we\n\n\nowe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share\n\n\nthis planet. Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every\n\n\nspecies has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any\n\n\neconomic value to us. We have a moral duty to care for their well-being\n\n\nand pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.\n\n\n13.2.2 How do we conserve Biodiversity?\n\n\nWhen we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all\n\n\nlevels is protected - we save the entire forest to save the tiger. This approach\n\n\nis called\n \nin situ\n \n(on site) conservation. However, when there are situations\n\n\nwhere an animal or plant is endangered or threatened (organisms facing\n\n\na very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future) and needs\n\n\nurgent measures to save it from extinction,\n \nex situ\n \n(off site) conservation\n\n\nis the desirable approach.\n\n\nIn situ\n \nconservation–\n \nFaced with the conflict between development and\n\n\nconservation, many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible\n\n\nto conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number of species\n\n\nwaiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources\n\n\navailable. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent\n\n\nconservationists. They identified for maximum protection certain\n\n\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness\n\n\nand high degree of\n \nendemism\n \n(that is, species confined to that region\n\n\nand not found anywhere else).\n \nInitially 25 biodiversity hotspots were\n\n\nidentified but subsequently nine more have been added to the list,\n\n\nbringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.\n\n\nThese hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of\n\n\nthese hotspots – Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and\n\n\nHimalaya – cover our country’s exceptionally high biodiversity regions.\n\n\nAlthough all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than\n\n\n2 per cent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively\nRationalised 2023-24","225\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\n\nharbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could\n\n\nreduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.\n\n\nIn India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally\n\n\nprotected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries. India\n\n\nnow has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife\n\n\nsanctuaries. India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions\n\n\nthat emphasised protection of nature. In many cultures, tracts of forest\n\n\nwere set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and\n\n\ngiven total protection. Such\n \nsacred groves\n \nare found in Khasi and Jaintia\n\n\nHills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of\n\n\nKarnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas\n\n\nof Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges\n\n\nfor a large number of rare and threatened plants.\n\n\nEx situ\n \nConservation–\n \nIn this approach, threatened animals and plants\n\n\nare taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting\n\n\nwhere they can be protected and given special care.\n \nZoological parks,\n\n\nbotanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are\n\n\nmany animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be\n\n\nmaintained in zoological parks. In recent years\n \nex situ\n \nconservation has\n\n\nadvanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures. Now gametes\n\n\nof threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for\n\n\nlong periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised\n \nin\n\n\nvitro\n,\n \nand plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods. Seeds\n\n\nof different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept\n\n\nfor long periods in seed banks.\n\n\nBiodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is\n\n\ntherefore a collective responsibility of all nations. The historic Convention\n\n\non Biological Diversity (‘The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in\n\n\n1992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for\n\n\nconservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits. In\n\n\na follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002\n\n\nin Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment\n\n\nto achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity\n\n\nloss at global, regional and local levels.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nSince life originated on earth nearly 3.8 billion years ago, there had\n\n\nbeen enormous diversification of life forms on earth. Biodiversity refers\n\n\nto the sum total of diversity that exists at all levels of biological\n\n\norganisation. Of particular importance is the diversity at genetic, species\n\n\nand ecosystem levels and conservation efforts are aimed at protecting\n\n\ndiversity at all these levels.\n\n\nMore than 1.5 million species have been recorded in the world, but\n\n\nthere might still be nearly 6 million species on earth waiting to be\nRationalised 2023-24","226\n\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n\ndiscovered and named. Of the named species, > 70 per cent are animals,\n\n\nof which 70 per cent are insects.\n \nThe group Fungi has more species\n\n\nthan all the vertebrate species combined.\n \nIndia, with about 45,000\n\n\nspecies of plants and twice as many species of animals, is one of the 12\n\n\nmega diversity countries of the world.\n\n\nSpecies diversity on earth is not uniformly distributed but shows\n\n\ninteresting patterns.\n \nIt is generally highest in the tropics and decreases\n\n\ntowards the poles. Important explanations for the species richness of\n\n\nthe tropics are: Tropics had more evolutionary time; they provide a\n\n\nrelatively constant environment and, they receive more solar energy\n\n\nwhich contributes to greater productivity. Species richness is also\n\n\nfunction of the area of a region; the species-area relationship is generally\n\n\na rectangular hyperbolic function.\n\n\nIt is believed that communities with high diversity tend to be less\n\n\nvariable, more productive and more resistant to biological invasions.\n\n\nEarth’s fossil history reveals incidence of mass extinctions in the past,\n\n\nbut the present rates of extinction, largely attributed to human activities,\n\n\nare 100 to 1000 times higher.\n \nNearly 700 species have become extinct\n\n\nin recent times and more than 15,500 species (of which > 650 are from\n\n\nIndia) currently face the threat of extinction.\n \nThe causes of high\n\n\nextinction rates at present include habitat (particularly forests) loss\n\n\nand fragmentation, over -exploitation, biological invasions and\n\n\nco-extinctions.\n\n\nEarth’s rich biodiversity is vital for the very survival of mankind.\n\n\nThe reasons for conserving biodiversity are narrowly utilitarian, broadly\n\n\nutilitarian and ethical.\n \nBesides the direct benefits (food, fibre, firewood,\n\n\npharmaceuticals, etc.), there are many indirect benefits we receive\n\n\nthrough ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate\n\n\nmoderation and flood control. We also have a moral responsibility to\n\n\ntake good care of earth’s biodiversity and pass it on in good order to our\n\n\nnext generation.\n\n\nBiodiversity conservation may be\n \nin situ\n \nas well as\n \nex situ.\n \nIn\n \nin situ\n\n\nconservation, the endangered species are protected in their natural\n\n\nhabitat so that the entire ecosystem is protected. Recently, 34\n\n\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ in the world have been proposed for intensive\n\n\nconservation efforts. Of these, three (Western Ghats-Sri Lanka,\n\n\nHimalaya and Indo-Burma) cover India’s rich biodiversity regions. Our\n\n\ncountry’s\n \nin situ\n \nconservation efforts are reflected in its 14 biosphere\n\n\nreserves, 90 national parks, > 450 wildlife sanctuaries and many sacred\n\n\ngroves.\n \nEx situ\n \nconservation methods include protective maintenance\n\n\nof threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens,\n \nin vitro\n\n\nfertilisation, tissue culture propagation and cryopreservation of\n\n\ngametes.\n\n\nEXERCISES\n\n\n1.\n \nName the three important components of biodiversity.\n\n\n2.\n \nHow do ecologists estimate the total number of species present in the\n\n\nworld?\nRationalised 2023-24","227\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\n\n3.\n \nGive three hypotheses for explaining why tropics show greatest levels\n\n\nof species richness.\n\n\n4.\n \nWhat is the significance of the slope of regression in a species – area\n\n\nrelationship?\n\n\n5.\n \nWhat are the major causes of species losses in a geographical region?\n\n\n6.\n \nHow is biodiversity important for ecosystem functioning?\n\n\n7.\n \nWhat are sacred groves?
